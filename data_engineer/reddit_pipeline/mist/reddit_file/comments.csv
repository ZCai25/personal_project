I was watching the CNN Town Hall yesterday. They put on people from East Palestine and they had the chance to ask the Norfolk CEO about their community. Suffice it to say the people were not pleased. One of them, a man in his 60's, railed against Norfolk and said ""their company sucks"". He wanted to know how a train could have 2 trainees? driving it, and the CEO kept deflecting by saying he couldn't comment on an existing investigation. Those weren't the answers the community wanted to hear. They wanted to know why a few days after the accident, trains were running again on the tracks. 

It was very difficult to keep a dry eye throughout the special. The man in his 60's said his land value went way down because of the accident. He worked his ass off, for so long, preparing to retire, and then his land value dipped, he wanted to know if Norfolk would compensate him or the community for that. I felt so much sympathy for what those people are going through, especially when many of them complained that they went to the doctor with chronic nosebleeds and the doctor said ""We don't know what's going on. We can't do anything about this.""

Since then all events described within have come to pass. \\ue022e prophecies are absolutely, factually true and have, thus, supplanted all other Scripture. Around this cathedral has grown Galgenbeck, the greatest city that ever was.

Verhu predicts inexorable annihilation and, since he‚Äôs always right, has become u\\ue021erly full of himself. His is also the head worshipped most. If you could learn the codes of the apocalypse perhaps the right o\\ue03aerings might avert it? Verhu loves his position and hungers for temples to be raised in his name.

Few have ever seen her, the oldest, but many walk her twin paths. \\ue024\\ue025\\ue028 spawned many since the dawn of time, their conceptions not without agony. All were cast down the cli\\ue03as of Bergen Chrypt, only \\ue025\\ue028 survived. Down in the Valley of the Unfortunate Undead his eyes locked upon the mountain‚Äôs peak, \\ue025\\ue028 spits out curses upon his evil mother. \\ue022e head Gorgh is bi\\ue021er, rank with envy that only his twin Verhu knows the damned truth. Time and time again his prophecies are brought to be. \\ue022e piles of gold-gift riches from his faithful teeter and slide, so tall are they.

Cracks grow in the once-stable structures of the past, allowing things misshapen and vile to worm through, emerging into day‚Äôs wan light. \\ue022e world closes in, bounded to the west by the massive Bergen Chrypt with its catacombs and ice-caked peaks east. Many have ploughed the wave‚Äôs furrow in search of and surrounded by the Endless Sea to the north, south and known new lands. \\ue022ey all return, against their will. Alive or dead.

No King or Queen rules in Galgenbeck but an arch-priestess: Josilfa Migol. Deep beneath the Cathedral of the Two-Headed Basilisks, in a cool black chamber crossed by shards of light, lies her throne. Josilfa, old but still young, commoners gossip that she colludes with the god Nechrubel, who gave her eternal life. Nechrubel: the shadow that covers all. Nechrubel is melancholy, crop failure, conflict and war. It is said he whispered the apocalyptic prophecies in Verhu‚Äôs ear. As time grows ever shorter the Two-Headed Basilisks become ever-more desperate in their recruitment. To take one‚Äôs own life is considered sinful cowardice. \\ue022e road to salvation lies through mortification of the flesh; the apocalypse is to be met with eyes wide open. Only then can the soul be allowed passage to the Shimmering Fields. Heretics and apostates are hunted down and corrected, in public and at length, by the Inquisition.

Paths tangle and wind in the overgrown gloom, leading wanderers astray. Far in the depths of Sarkash, always where one least expects to find it, in a halo of dying trees, is Graven-Tosk. A truly ancient cemetery filled with mausoleums, blank-eyed cherubs, stagnant fountains, plague pits and ordinary graves. But hasn‚Äôt it grown warmer in this usually cold place? Do you hear the frantic scratching? \\ue022e air feels heavy, stale and hard to breathe.

Most of the palace lies in crumbling ruins, home to unfortunate souls sheltering beneath its broken halls. None dare dream what might lie under the rubble covered catacombs and cellars. Tunnels sprawl beneath like writhing roots, digging deeper into the cold earth like cancerous veins. \\ue022e inner wing still stands, acting as the home of the Shadow King, a being obscured by ritual. \\ue022e slaves of the servants of the courtiers of the King come forth and do his will. \\ue022e title is hereditary: sons are always born to the Shadow King. It‚Äôs whispered Princes of that line disguise themselves as ordinary men wandering the ruins engaging in games and tricking travelers, multiplying the miseries of their people.

Cut from the world by the bo\\ue021omless M√∫r, the thriving city state can be reached only by three bridges of such might and cyclopean size it is said that only enslaved giants could have raised them. Grift was once a place of harmony and the light of reason, a shelter from the plaguewracked, war-torn world beyond. But the world turns and even the M√∫r cannot protect Grift from its inevitable fall. King Sigf√∫m the Kind is mocked in the street. Much of Grift has fallen into disrepair as vile creatures begin crawling from the dried, cracked earth. Each night the bridges scream and roar like great ships grinding upon rocks. Sigf√∫m is defeated. He knows the end is near, believes the prophecies of Verhu and so, kindly and calmly, prepares his people for death. Huge parchments dot the streets, calendars of despair marking each correct preparation and its time. Each day a leaf is turned and when the last page comes, Sigf√∫m will march his people to the cli\\ue03a Terion to fulfill what was wri\\ue021en. Terion, a thousand meters of vertical rock with the raging sea biting at its base. \\ue022e inquisition of the Two-Headed Basilisks is not too keen on the heretical suicide scheme of Sigf√∫m the Kind.

North, where the wind is born, lies Alli√°ns, a storm-piercing spire-city of black glass. Within stands a castle like a waterfall of white stone: the throne of Anthelia. She as pale as her castle‚Äôs walls, as youthful as a drop of melting ice. Some say she is eternally young. \\ue022e gulls cry the names of Knights who sought her hand, a reminder that suitors and signs of Anthelia‚Äôs age disappear in conjunction. But who listens to a gull? And in Kerg√ºs, even gulls freeze in the cold that rolls from the dreams of the Countess. Dreams of her unending youth. Anthelia‚Äôs Ambivalence Anthelia is well aware time is short. Neuroses burden her. ‚ÄúWhy is everything so pale? So cold?‚Äù She cries out for colour or warmth. She drains the world of both with every glance, touch and breath. \\ue022ose who bring her vibrant life are promised great rewards. All fear to do so. Excuses are made, explanations found. \\ue022e feelings of the Countess are fragile, her powers absolute. Court life entails grey opulence, excitement and fear.

Since then all events described within have come to pass. \\ue022e prophecies are absolutely, factually true and have, thus, supplanted all other Scripture. Around this cathedral has grown Galgenbeck, the greatest city that ever was. ', 'T\\ue025\\ue028 \\ue036\\ue023\\ue024\\ue02a\\ue02d\\ue02a\\ue024\\ue037\\ue024 \\ue023\\ue027\\ue028 \\ue030\\ue038\\ue034 \\ue023\\ue02b\\ue031 \\ue030\\ue038\\ue034-\\ue025\\ue028\\ue023\\ue031\\ue028\\ue031. \\ue022e four heads have argued for hundreds of years. Verhu predicts inexorable annihilation and, since he‚Äôs always right, has become u\\ue021erly full of himself. His is also the head worshipped most. If you could learn the codes of the apocalypse perhaps the right o\\ue03aerings might avert it? Verhu loves his position and hungers for temples to be raised in his name. ', 'W\\ue025\\ue028\\ue02b \\ue030\\ue025\\ue028 \\ue038\\ue034\\ue027\\ue02d\\ue031 was but water, dust and clouds thick with plague-fat flies came \\ue024\\ue025\\ue028, first of the basilisks. From the cracks of Bergen Chrypt \\ue024\\ue025\\ue028 crawled. \\ue024\\ue025\\ue028 bears the head of Denial, Lusi, who looks up and down. Yet all shall be well. Her twin Arkh, Head of Deception, claims to be the first prophet of truths now prostituted by Verhu. Few have ever seen her, the oldest, but many walk her twin paths. \\ue024\\ue025\\ue028 spawned many since the dawn of time, their conceptions not without agony. All were cast down the cli\\ue03as of Bergen Chrypt, only \\ue025\\ue028 survived. Down in the Valley of the Unfortunate Undead his eyes locked upon the mountain‚Äôs peak, \\ue025\\ue028 spits out curses upon his evil mother. \\ue022e head Gorgh is bi\\ue021er, rank with envy that only his twin Verhu knows the damned truth. Time and time again his prophecies are brought to be. \\ue022e piles of gold-gift riches from his faithful teeter and slide, so tall are they. ', 'T\\ue025\\ue028 \\ue038\\ue034\\ue027\\ue02d\\ue031 \\ue031\\ue02a\\ue028\\ue024 \\ue028\\ue02c\\ue028\\ue02b \\ue02b\\ue034\\ue038. Reality decays, truth becomes dream and dream, truth. Cracks grow in the once-stable structures of the past, allowing things misshapen and vile to worm through, emerging into day‚Äôs wan light. \\ue022e world closes in, bounded to the west by the massive Bergen Chrypt with its catacombs and ice-caked peaks east. Many have ploughed the wave‚Äôs furrow in search of and surrounded by the Endless Sea to the north, south and known new lands. \\ue022ey all return, against their will. Alive or dead. Galgenbeck G\\ue023\\ue02d\\ue026\\ue028\\ue02b\\ue036\\ue028\\ue035\\ue037 \\ue02a\\ue02b \\ue030\\ue025\\ue028 \\ue02d\\ue023\\ue02b\\ue031 \\ue034\\ue02e \\ue030\\ue02c\\ue028\\ue02d\\ue023\\ue02b\\ue031 is the greatest city that ever was. No King or Queen rules in Galgenbeck but an arch-priestess: Josilfa Migol. Deep beneath the Cathedral of the Two-Headed Basilisks, in a cool black chamber crossed by shards of light, lies her throne. Josilfa, old but still young, commoners gossip that she colludes with the god Nechrubel, who gave her eternal life. Nechrubel: the shadow that covers all. Nechrubel is melancholy, crop failure, conflict and war. It is said he whispered the apocalyptic prophecies in Verhu‚Äôs ear. As time grows ever shorter the Two-Headed Basilisks become ever-more desperate in their recruitment. To take one‚Äôs own life is considered sinful cowardice. \\ue022e road to salvation lies through mortification of the flesh; the apocalypse is to be met with eyes wide open. Only then can the soul be allowed passage to the Shimmering Fields. Heretics and apostates are hunted down and corrected, in public and at length, by the Inquisition. In Tveland also lies Sarkash T\\ue025\\ue028 \\ue02e\\ue034\\ue027\\ue028\\ue024\\ue030 \\ue024\\ue028\\ue028\\ue032\\ue024, lately, to spread unnaturally fast. Paths tangle and wind in the overgrown gloom, leading wanderers astray. Far in the depths of Sarkash, always where one least expects to find it, in a halo of dying trees, is Graven-Tosk. A truly ancient cemetery filled with mausoleums, blank-eyed cherubs, stagnant fountains, plague pits and ordinary graves. But hasn‚Äôt it grown warmer in this usually cold place? Do you hear the frantic scratching? \\ue022e air feels heavy, stale and hard to breathe. Rising over Graven-Tosk like rage rising over pain is the Palace of the Shadow King A \\ue026\\ue034\\ue030\\ue025\\ue02a\\ue035 \\ue036\\ue02d\\ue023\\ue035\\ue037 \\ue035\\ue023\\ue024\\ue030\\ue02d\\ue028, like a mirror to the Cathedral of the Two-Headed Basilisk in Galgenbeck. Most of the palace lies in crumbling ruins, home to unfortunate souls sheltering beneath its broken halls. None dare dream what might lie under the rubble covered catacombs and cellars. Tunnels sprawl beneath like writhing roots, digging deeper into the cold earth like cancerous veins. \\ue022e inner wing still stands, acting as the home of the Shadow King, a being obscured by ritual. \\ue022e slaves of the servants of the courtiers of the King come forth and do his will. \\ue022e title is hereditary: sons are always born to the Shadow King. It‚Äôs whispered Princes of that line disguise themselves as ordinary men wandering the ruins engaging in games and tricking travelers, multiplying the miseries of their people. Grift F\\ue027\\ue034\\ue032 \\ue023\\ue026\\ue028\\ue024 \\ue033\\ue023\\ue024\\ue030, Grift grew upon an eastern peninsula of the Endless Sea. Cut from the world by the bo\\ue021omless M√∫r, the thriving city state can be reached only by three bridges of such might and cyclopean size it is said that only enslaved giants could have raised them. Grift was once a place of harmony and the light of reason, a shelter from the plaguewracked, war-torn world beyond. But the world turns and even the M√∫r cannot protect Grift from its inevitable fall. King Sigf√∫m the Kind is mocked in the street. Much of Grift has fallen into disrepair as vile creatures begin crawling from the dried, cracked earth. Each night the bridges scream and roar like great ships grinding upon rocks. Sigf√∫m is defeated. He knows the end is near, believes the prophecies of Verhu and so, kindly and calmly, prepares his people for death. Huge parchments dot the streets, calendars of despair marking each correct preparation and its time. Each day a leaf is turned and when the last page comes, Sigf√∫m will march his people to the cli\\ue03a Terion to fulfill what was wri\\ue021en. Terion, a thousand meters of vertical rock with the raging sea biting at its base. \\ue022e inquisition of the Two-Headed Basilisks is not too keen on the heretical suicide scheme of Sigf√∫m the Kind. Kerg√ºs D\\ue028\\ue024\\ue034\\ue02d\\ue023\\ue030\\ue02a\\ue034\\ue02b \\ue027\\ue034\\ue02d\\ue02d\\ue024 \\ue034\\ue02c\\ue028\\ue027 \\ue037\\ue028\\ue027\\ue026\\ue03b\\ue024 like a frostbarren wind. \\ue022e lawless and forlorn trek across its ice-wracked expanse, crawling over the plains or cowering in the cracked earth to flee  Blood-Countess Anthelia. North, where the wind is born, lies Alli√°ns, a storm-piercing spire-city of black glass. Within stands a castle like a waterfall of white stone: the throne of Anthelia. She as pale as her castle‚Äôs walls, as youthful as a drop of melting ice. Some say she is eternally young. \\ue022e gulls cry the names of Knights who sought her hand, a reminder that suitors and signs of Anthelia‚Äôs age disappear in conjunction. But who listens to a gull? And in Kerg√ºs, even gulls freeze in the cold that rolls from the dreams of the Countess. Dreams of her unending youth. ', 'Anthelia is well aware time is short. Neuroses burden her. ‚ÄúWhy is everything so pale? So cold?‚Äù She cries out for colour or warmth. She drains the world of both with every glance, touch and breath. \\ue022ose who bring her vibrant life are promised great rewards. All fear to do so. Excuses are made, explanations found. \\ue022e feelings of the Countess are fragile, her powers absolute. Court life entails grey opulence, excitement and fear. The Western Kingdom T\\ue025\\ue028 \\ue038\\ue028\\ue024\\ue030\\ue028\\ue027\\ue02b \\ue037\\ue02a\\ue02b\\ue026\\ue031\\ue034\\ue032, called W√§stland in the songs of the simple and rhymes of the poor, once home to peace and wealth when Lake Onda gifted fish and the river-trade thrived. Now, terror and despotism stalk. In the secret citadel of the sad-but-gaudy city of Schleswig King Fathmu IX schemes. Paranoid, fat and increasingly mad, he is consumed with psychosis and invisible fears. Obsessed with the prophecies of Verhu, the King raids and invades houses and villages, barns and temples.

If you gaze upon a candle, lamp or torch it goes out. 11 Within \\ue02b4 days a vile cocoon heaves from the ground, soon bursting and spawning your exact clone. It is unintelligent and begins to spread mischief and su\\ue021ering. \\ue022is happens every couple of days until the ground is cleansed with holy water or fire. 12 Your eyes burn with insu\\ue039erable agony, bleeding heavily before loosening and falling from their gory pits. You continue to see through them wherever they are. 13 You and a random nearby creature pass out. When you wake up, your souls have switched. Welcome to your new flesh. 14 Five twisted, skeletal arms burst from your back. \\ue037e hands are mischievous, violent and terribly cruel. 15 Your skin pales then begins to emit a sickly greenish light. Living things held close to you slowly fall ill. \\ue022ey weaken, their bones become bri\\ue023le, their teeth and hair fall out. 16 \\ue037e Power works, but fate or a demonic force perverts its e\\ue039ects to your precise disadvantage. 17 \\ue037e scroll crumbles to tendrils of fine black powder which reach for your nose and mouth.

When resting you restore only half of the rolled \\ue029\\ue025. 19 You fall through Refva into the esoteric dimension of Cube-Violet, a place of mythical obscurity. \\ue037e walls are smooth, iridescent and cold. Above, an endless inferno.  To leave (\\ue02a4): 1. Slay riddling Kulvan (strong goblin, page 58)   who holds three colorless pearls. 2. Poison a close friend with crumbled Sict-Shroom    (Toughness \\ue02b\\ue03116 or -\\ue02b6 \\ue029\\ue025 and hallucinations).  \\ue037ey are found only within the cube. 3.

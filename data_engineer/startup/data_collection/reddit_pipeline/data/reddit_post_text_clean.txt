5. A dinner with the hag
6. “May I have a moment of your time?” The hag can take a single memory /knid44)

9. Break up true love /PumpkinLighter)

3,"Insanity should not be as simple as babbling nonsense and backstabbing party members as soon as they turn their back, at least not from the very beginning. That's the last step, but in between there's a window of opportunity to roleplay how a character, be it a PC or an NPC, slowly descends into madness.

I create this list of hints that may indicate a character they're going mad because I want to avoid the explicit 'you just lost 6 sanity points'.

Lastly, I think it would be nice to include a tag in the form of [mild], [moderate] or [severe] to better understand the severity of the described issue and what's the impact on the character's daily life.

&nbsp;

#D100 hints of madness

&nbsp;

1. [Mild] They're starting to think others in the party are hiding/moving their stuff. They don't question why would others even bother to do that, they just assume this fact and try to carry on. They might end indirectly accusing someone of hiding their stuff or sharing this thought with others.

2. [Mild] They keep close watch of their shadow/reflections because they've been acting strange lately.

3. [Moderate] Once the character starts a fight, they find it increasingly difficult to stop no matter the situation. Additionally, they tend to always use lethal blows, even when attacking clearly disfavored foes or important targets.

4. [Moderate] ""Yeah, they've been carrying around equipment for survival in the desert. Again."" ""What? Why? The closest one is 500 miles away, and we're not planning on going there anyways.""

5. [Severe] As if they had just woken up from a nightmare, the character screams ""SHUT THE F*CK UP GOD DAMN!"" when no one's even talking. Immediately after, they breathe deeply and return to absolute calm again. They refuse to give further explanation.

6. [Severe] ""I mark myself and my allies with complex cuts in the skin. If they're my allies after all, why wouldn't they want to be recognized as such? Do they hide something?""
---

7. [Moderate] They become irrationally angry at the sound of children playing or singing. The intensity of their anger is uncharacteristic for their personality, and frightening. /onepostandbye]

8. [Moderate] The character develops a habit of hair-chewing. It’s barely noticeable, and manifests under stress. In time, the habit develops into a full-blown hair-eating compulsion. Every day, the character feels he or she must cut off and consume an amount of their hair. It does not taste good, and over time the hair causes a variety of digestive issues. But the compulsion grows. Every day, the character is joylessly, anxiously eating more hair. They cannot be logically dissuaded from this compulsion. /onepostandbye]

9. [Mild] They start to just not wash themselves due to a fear of squids, even if the water isn't deep or is clear. /killllllllllmeeeeee]

10. [Mild] They keep on forgetting/obviating things, even if they are right in sight. Oppositely, they glom onto insignificant things, unable to let them go. /killllllllllmeeeeee]

11. [Moderate] They start to stay up at night to look at the blinking stars, saying they're delivering a message. /killllllllllmeeeeee]

12. [Moderate] they won't let their hands go (not again), always holding them. /killllllllllmeeeeee]

13. [Severe] They start to carve messages into their skin in a language they think they know, when it's completely foreign. /killllllllllmeeeeee]

14. [Moderate] The character constantly feels the presence of someone or something watching them just out of their sight behind them. If they engage in a skill or spell that requires concentration, they must pass a Constitution check, or lose full concentration as their eyes are seemingly forced to look behind them constantly to try and catch a glimpse of the hidden entity. /Beebrains]

15. [Mild to Severe] The character feels as though their skin/scales/feathers are infested with unnatural creatures crawling on them. A Constitution saving throw determines how intense the sensation is: 
On a 16-20 it is mildly annoying but easily ignorable; on a 11-15 it is moderately uncomfortable, and they will gain disadvantage on any task that requires concentration; on a 6-10 it is highly uncomfortable, and they will lose concentration immediately on any task; on a 1-5 it it is unbearable, and they must make an attack role against themselves, taking slashing damage from clawing on a successful hit. /Beebrains]

16. [Mild] The character has fits of uncontainable laughter at inappropriate moments. If they become affected by the spell Tasha's Hideous Laughter, instead of being under the effect of uncontrollable fits of laughter, they become incredibly morose and depressed. /Beebrains]

17. [Mild] There is a buzzing sound coming from another character’s left knee. It’s worthy of some investigation. /ButtonholePhotophile]

18. [Mild] Multiple overlapping noises merge together, turning almost into a music-like noise. /ButtonholePhotophile]

19. [Moderate] You forget the rationale for your conclusions before you reach your conclusions. You trust your conclusions, however, because why wouldn’t you? /ButtonholePhotophile]

20. [Severe] As you become all-knowing, you gain +10 to all ability checks you are not proficient in and +15 to all ability checks you are proficient in. The DM should then subtract 17 from any of those rolls. /ButtonholePhotophile]

21. [Mild] They obsessively check that their doors and windows are locked, several times a day. /qo33a]

22. [Mild] They quietly say the word “blood” to themselves at random intervals. There is no apparent trigger and they are unaware of the behavior. /onepostandbye]

23. [Mild] The character develops some kind of synesthesia, mixing up common senses as they describe things. Bright light will leave the taste of peppers and the smell of coffee. A beautiful song will feel smooth like satin as it shimmers through the air. /F4C3L3S5_J0e]

24. [Moderate] The character will say they have a partner they always work with. The partner is very shy, and often forages for food or works somewhere else. This is why they only show up when no one else is looking and why the character will always have to update their partner on recent developments. /F4C3L3S5_J0e]

25. [Moderate] The character will talk to fallen corpses like they are old friends. On the other hand, they will interact with the living as little as possible, like the character is in disguise and afraid of getting caught. /F4C3L3S5_J0e]

26. [Mild-Moderate] The character will frequently be fixated on nothing in particular. Usually their eyes will be glued to a single spot, but sometimes their eyes will wonder slowly around themselves or others. They will sometimes move rapidly so not to break vision with what they are fixated with. /F4C3L3S5_J0e]

27. [Moderate] They subconciously 'packrat' stray, tiny objects such as bugs, cool rocks... but each bedtime they complain about all the useless stuff they find in their gear. They do not acknowledge picking them up, except sarcastically. 
Sharp eyes can sometimes see they are pocketing something, but not exactly what. /pinosaur]

28. [Mild to Severe] They will refuse to go out of their house/home at certain times, becoming angry, upset or combative if pressed to: Mild for infrequent date combinations (Friday the 13th, their birthday, an anniversary...); Moderate for frequent regular dates (every Sunday, when there's full moon...); Severe for extended or unpredictable periods (all of July, when it is raining, after they see a black cat from their window...). /Prod_Red]

29. [Mild] They carry a tuning fork on their person at all times, and will tap and hold it against random objects (or people) and then listen to the note that it makes. When questioned about this, they may always give the same peculiar explanation, or give a different explanation every time. /Prod_Red]

30. [Moderate] They develop a powerful affinity towards a particular food and regard eating it as holy communion. They will become anxious and angry if they aren’t able to consume it regularly. /FestiveSlaad]

31. [Moderate] The character constantly scans surroundings for danger. This provides advantage to avoid being surprised, but also confirms the suspicions of the character, worsening their behaviour even further. /Ichthyslovesyou]

32. [Severe] They finally discover that sources of light actually reveal all of their innermost thoughts and secrets to anyone who just looks at them. The brighter the light, the more is revealed. As a consequence, the more they catch someone, anyone, looking at them, the more irrational and potentially violent
they are likely to become. /Ichthyslovesyou]

33. [Moderate] The character experiences a steadily growing feeling that the innocuous chatter of birds and animals really contains a hidden message. There's a 5% cummulative chance per day of study that the affected character actually finds a meaning. /Ichthyslovesyou]

34. [Mild] They believe most conversations, specially those they can't hear, are secretly about themselves. They will spin elaborate theories to explain
how, and may seek to personally confirm them. /Ichthyslovesyou]

35. [Moderate] The character lies sometimes and occasionally stares directly into the sun. When encountered about either, the person becomes upset or enraged. /Arkenstihl]

36. [Mild] The character can't seem to tear their gaze away from bare feet. /Arkenstihl]

37. [Severe] The character's long-term memory is gone. They really only live in the surrounding three or four minutes. Rapid onset with sudden mood changes are common, as a consequence. /Arkenstihl]

38. [Severe] The character is certain they have a warlock-like death pact with a horrible creature. They act in accordance with the entity's demands. /Arkenstihl]

39. [Moderate] The character loses their innate fear of predators and frightening creatures, giving them a natural immunity to Frightful Presence, but making them want to approach these creatures. /DragonDestroyer204]

40. [Severe] He's here. The Blue Man has started harassing and following the character around, just slightly outside of their sight. The Blue Man is harmful. The character will do the impossible to scape him but he's clever and fast. /DragonDestroyer204]

41. [Mild] The character will believe themselves to have some innate, hidden power within and will attempt to awaken it or use it to protect themselves. /DragonDestroyer204]

42. [Moderate] The character begins to worry that their friends and family have been replaced by doppelgangers (the monster, not just lookalike people of the same species). /VoltasPistol]

43. [Mild] ""Hey, can you hear music? I was sure I could hear music coming from over there."" /Erivandi]

44. [Moderate] ""Hey, have I done something to offend you? You seem like you're mad at me. No, please, you have to tell me what I did wrong! Please, I'm sorry! I'll make it right, just tell me what I did!"" /Erivandi]

45. [Severe] the character becomes severely claustrophobic, to the point of becoming violent and erratic if forced to enter any sort of enclosed space, even if said space is not that narrow. /optisadvantage]

46. [Mild] The affected character always comment how the present situation is so similar to things they have supposedly done in their youth. They use their so-called experience to give advice to the party, however said ""advice"" is almost always immediately dangerous and counter-intuitive. /Sir_Lazz]

47. [Moderate] The character is absolutely certain that anything metallic is actually a knock-off: they will tend to quickly abandon good equipment, pretexting it is rusty and made of a bad alloy. They suspect every gold coin to actually be fool's gold, and so on. /Sir_Lazz]

48. [Severe] The character is deadly afraid of poisons, and will obsess over any scratch or small cut, believing they might be deadly. They will not eat anything they haven't prepared themselves, will not allow anyone to get close to their food and supplies, and will refuse to drink any beverage that isn't pure water. They will act paranoid and be wary of everyone, and can even get violent. /Sir_Lazz]

49. [Moderate] The character has an unnatural and inexplicable fear of a random shape or color, and will not get close or interact with anything that includes said shape or color. /Sir_Lazz]

50. [Moderate] The character finds themselves thinking about a children’s story they learned as a youth. In it, Gōl, the King of Toads, plagued the villagers outside his home with a variety of nuisances. The stories occupy the character’s mind, and whenever anyone utters a word containing a “gole” sound (“gold”, “goal”, “angle”), the character will shout “GŌL!” in a childishly comical way. Sometimes this habit will leave the character howling in laughter, incapacitated. /onepostandbye]

51. [Severe] The character begins to refer to themselves in the third person when joking or making humorous observations. This behavior increases in frequency, and within six weeks the character cannot use a pronoun for themselves, they must refer to themselves in the third person by their own name. Within six months, the character cannot communicate except to narrate the present as if by an author (“Regdar wondered if his friend had used all of her healing magic, as his wounds burned terribly.”). As the one-year mark approaches, the character’s mind begins to disassociate from its core identity, as it begins to watch the actions of its former self from afar. With the ego’s departure, a new personality begins to manifest in the place previously occupied by the untethered one. /onepostandbye]

52. [Mild] Can't remember anything of note recently. When asked, they shrug it off. During tense/pivotal moments, they seem distracted, as if they aren't quite paying attention to the scene around them. /agb64]

53. [Moderate] They play with corpses. When asked, they just say that they're looking for things they can loot, even if the bodies had nothing on them beforehand. /agb64]

54. [Severe] No impulse control. They will say anything on their mind and will do anything they wish, and cannot explain why wouldn't someone do these things. /agb64]

4,"I'm planning an encounter where the PC's will find a discount magic shop run by what is effectively a circus promoter (a ""step right up!!"" kinda guy). Want to build a list of items that do what they say on the tin, just not what you actually wanted. If you've ever played paranoia you know exactly what I'm looking for.

What I've got so far:

1. Scroll of Fly - A scroll that summons a fruit fly.
2. scroll of produce flame - A scroll that when used, catches on fire like flash paper.
3. Scroll of Detect Magic - A scroll that when used, confirms to the player that the scroll is in fact, magical.
4. Scroll of Identify -  A scroll that loudly (and proudly) announces the name of the user.
5. A ring of water breathing - Holds 1 charge and regains that charge daily. When used, for the next 10 minutes the wearer grows a set of gills and can breath under water... but ceases to be able to breathe air, and begins suffocating. Removing the ring ends the effect early.
6. Ring of Feather Falling - A ring that falls through the air as if light as a feather and makes no noise upon hitting the ground."

6,"**The pitch:** You're kinda low on the totem pole, though not entirely a grunt. You're regarded as a sort of sergeant, maybe it's because they saw what happened to the last guy who crossed you people, or maybe it's because you have some sort of social status on society. But you *are* part of a hierarchy of a military nature.

Everyone is currently out there doing the exciting stuff y'know; doing battle, solving murder mysteries, plundering forgotten places, and you're... stuck in garrison duty, watching the sheep and cows. So let's inject some life into it.

**The rules / assumed setting:** Let's try to keep monsters either rare or fierce. Think of a monster as The monster. That is, there aren't dragons running around like it's a fact of life - there is *The* dragon of the current year who has been causing trouble, and that's it.

More importantly: *you're garrison*. You're NOT the guy people will go to because they need you to solve something far away, you're the dude sitting on a watchtower or patrolling a perimeter. Also, you're not the cops, even if you're protecting a city, you can't just leave the road empty for a week while you go off look for a murderer.

Aside from that, I'd prefer to keep it medieval / pre-Early Modern, but that doesn't change too much. I'll be using ""Knights"" to mean ""fighting men of relatively minor status just like you"" because I usually play Pendragon, but you can just read it as ""gentleman"" or something.

## **1d100 Events During Garrison Duty**

1. Someone comes stumbling down the road. They either die on your arms, if you try to help, or at your feet, if you decide not to do anything. Either way, it *really* looks like you did it, and you gotta find out what happened before the next traveller comes - it could be your superior.

2. Your orders are to not let anyone pass. A poor old person comes and says they need to pass because their crops all died and now they're looking for a new life; if they go back, they won't make it to another checkpoint before dying. They're (1d5) 1. an assassin in disguise coming to snipe your superior, and they'll try to end you if you tell them not to pass; 2. a malevolent spirit intent on cursing the kingdom, but they'll settle for cursing you if you don't give them leave; 3. your patron, testing your ass to see if you're willing to make tough calls; 4. really, an old person, and they'll die now, nice going douche; 5. a fairy going to steal your or your patron's kids and put changelings instead.

3. Goddamn kids are trying to sneak away from the farm AGAIN. This time, though, they're saying it's because of men wearing the skin of wolves walking around the fields and terrorizing people. (1d2) 1. They're fucking with you lol dumbass; 2. they're legit.

4. A full company of raiders (probably outnumbering you but not by a whole lot, enough for a tough fight) are coming for something after your checkpoint. They offer you a little share of the loot - say, 10% - if you let them pass without a tussle, but they're more than willing to throw down. If you do, people WILL ask questions as to how could they pass without giving you so much as a scratch.

5. Someone with a noose around their neck and possibly chains in their hands. They've JUST escaped from the gallows and they tell you it's for a fair reason. They ask for you to either stand aside and pretend you didn't see them pass, or to let them hide inside your tower. 

6. A caravan of 2d10 people with 2d10 + 2 armed guards. Either this is a peaceful encounter and they bring plot-relevant news, fun rumours, and know a lot of stuff (9 in 10 chances of knowing about a common subject, 5 in 10 of knowing about more niche stuff that only adventurers would know), OR they don't have their papers in order and try to bribe you.

7. Oh shit, it's the magistrate! There's a 1 in 10 chance that he'll think you've commited a crime. Add +2 if you've actually commited a crime or social indiscretion recently (pilfering from the dead is, in fact, weirdo behavior), and +1 if your setting feature some sort of discrimination (if there's an elf, for instance, or if there's a magician, etc).

8. Great, it's a dangerous animal. It's either an angry mama bear, some pissed off boars, some lynxes, a pack of wolves / wild dogs, or a proper monster who does NOT want to be crossed right now. You can, of course, stay hidden and let the thing go on its way eventually, but it just might find another traveller... or just sit and sleep there!

9. WHAT, HO, SIR KNIGHT! It's a knight errant, and he's either looking for work (he stresses that he is NOT a mercenary, he IS of NOBLE birth as you can CLEARLY tell), or on a mission to protect someone - and may want to joust with you to impress this certain someone. Or it's just a cool ass dude, man, idk why you keep wanting to fight things, gosh, you're just like your mother.

10. Lepers, shunned by society, passing through. If you're a particularly cruel DM, ask for an Awareness (or equivalent) check to not mistake them for the undead. If you don't want wanton bloody murder of your fellow Christians, they're either begging (or asking to be left alone to beg in someplace with more people), or have gone fully mad and are now throwing themselves at people out of anger to try and take as much of the bastards who made them suffer along with them.

11. A mysterious stranger wants to pass. They're hooded and refuse to tell who they are; and worse, they might (6 in 10 chance) have 2d4 armed guards with them. They could be a hooded monk, a herald on a secret mission, an assassin coming to get your patron's ass, or a nobleman incognito.

12. Peasants coming home from work, you've probably seen them passing through earlier. They might have interesting rumours / food to sell. *Or* they look... different now than they did then. Was that guy always a blonde? And wait, I thought there were 4 of them, and now there's 3 (or worse, 5).

13. Pilgrims are passing through. They could be bringing interesting rumours from far-off lands or nice offerings for the god / saint / ancestor. They could also be grumbling to themselves about how pissed they are that just a while ago down the road they were robbed of a bit (or a lot) of cash. Wink wink.

14. An army is coming on their way to do battle. Shit, there's a LOT of them, too. You can either hide like a pussycat and risk having them pillage your tower, stand there arms akimbo requiring a kiss for entry and risk being ganged up by over a hundred different dudes, or (the safest and most logical course of action) praising them and saying ""YEEAH GET THEIR ASS!"". You might need to roll for it, though. On a fail, you've mistaken them for the army of their *opponent*, and now they're mad.

15. A very sudden shift in weather. If it's raining or snowing, it stops and the sun starts shining; if it's a nice summer day, a distant thunder echoes and in just a couple minutes the sky becomes black with a storm. There's some foul magic being worked in the region.

16. A wild monster decided to pass through. Simple as.

17. Did you know that when people die on the road, they're buried on the side? Well you know now, because the dead decided to rise out while you were sleeping. Depending on what kind of encounter you want to run, you either have to Night of the Living dead this shit (fortify and hold fast until morning / reinforcements, send out a pigeon), Evil Dead this shit (get the lads and start chopping), or 1600 this shit (bring the crosses and push them back to the ground / go find a priest to hallow this place).

18. It's night. The wind starts howling outside. You then notice it's not a windy night at all. You decide to check. There's a ghost haunting the road. It *might* have seen you.

19. A nice lady shows up at your door, asking for help and a place to sleep. It's pouring out too. She has a ribbon on her neck (or a necklace, if your players are savvy and already know where this story is going). If you let her in, she'll start flirting with everyone, talking about how her husband died and since then she hasn't felt the touch of a strong / caring person like you. If you do end up sleeping with her, you wake up next to a dead body filled with maggots, and may want to get checked for disease. If you sent her away, she'll come back as a vengeful ghost. If you just let her stay but didn't do anything, she'll be gone by the morrow. Big Peter down at the pub will tell ya that no one by that name has been seen around here for tweeeenty yeeeeeeeeeeeearss uuUuUUuUuUuHHhH! Or that that is a famous ghost and that you should just pray and try to forget about it.

20. A petite attractive girl very obviously picks your pocket and taunts you with your purse, then takes off, apparently hoping for a merry chase. Is it just a distraction? Is she just bored? Is she hitting on you? [/thelefthandN7]

21. Did you know that when people die on the road, they're buried on the side? Well you know now, because the dead decided to rise out while you were sleeping. And now they won't shut up about the terrible conditions... how their family never visits them... how someone stole their stuff after they died... the racket of the road... they just won't stop. And now they are demanding to speak to the guard captain... And if you attack them... they just complain about that too. [/thelefthandN7]

22. A disheveled young woman appears with a baby in her arms. She's very pale and cold to the touch. She insists you hold the baby. If you agree to hold the child, you notice it's icy cold and not moving, you then have to pass 3 increasingly difficult strength checks, if you succeed, the woman turns into a ghost and vanishes leaving you with a very alive baby. If you refuse, or fail the checks, the young woman reveals her ghostly nature and promises vengeance before vanishing. [/thelefthandN7]

23. You are approached by a frenzied Wizard. ""I'm going to put my Eldritch familiar in your extradimensional pocket!"" He says. How do you respond? [/thelefthandN7]

24. A group of mildly intoxicated young men in fine clothes are attempting to pass through the gates after curfew. They're the rich sort whose parents are going to be up in arms looking for them if they go missing, but also the sort who are entitled enough to try and push you around if you don't let them have their way. And of course if you do let them through your superior will have your hide. [/fuzzyfuzzyclickclack]

25. You cannot understand how someone could be so incompetent at hiding contraband as to put it literally in every textbook place you looked. It's not like you care enough about this job to actually look hard. Of course they are putting up a great hue and cry that it's not theirs, they don't know how it got there, they have powerful friends, their supplies are desperately needed for the orphanage, etc, but they're probably lying. Probably. [/fuzzyfuzzyclickclack]

26. You were stationed on duty as an extra shift for the festival which is going, on and for some reason the foreign tourists are fascinated by you and exceedingly inquisitive to the point of provocation. [/fuzzyfuzzyclickclack]

27. It seems that every few weeks another member of the guard is found dead of something innocuous; choked on a chicken bone, fell down the stairs, or accidentally impaled by the portcullis. A lot of the new recruits that are making up the number also seem rather familiar with each other. Should you keep your head down, not knowing whether you might be next? [/fuzzyfuzzyclickclack]

28. You and your mates have started a competition to see who can spit on the most nobles from the top of the wall in a day without them noticing. Unfortunately the little game spread, reached a fever pitch, and then drew the attention of the higher ups who are now looking for the ""seditious instigator of this disrespect."" [/fuzzyfuzzyclickclack]

29. A child approaches the gate and says they want to go home, upon asking where home is they answer with a convincing child-like answer for a nearby part of town. In the morning there are reports that a halfling broke in and burgled some businesses in that part of town. [/GandalffladnaG]

30. The local scam artist comes by selling their latest grift, a questionable meat product, and they're ""practically giving them away at that price"" (cut-me-own-throat Dibler type from Discworld) It could be hotdogs made from shoe leather they found in the local lake, it could be shepards pie made from rats, it could be jerky from previous failed shoe leather hotdogs with the mold wiped off. [/GandalffladnaG]

31. Your wife shows up with a hot meal. Wait, what is today? Is it your anniversary? You'd probably remember something important like that. Is it your birthday already? No, it's not winter yet. Oh no, is her sister moving in? The Mrs wouldn't just bring hot food all the way over here without a reason, would she? Something is going on. What could it be? ""Yes dear, it's wonderful to see you! Oh, you brought lunch? That's so nice of you."" ANXIETY AND PANIC. [/GandalffladnaG]

32. An old hag stops and asks if you've seen her lost pet cat. She offers to un-curse anyone who finds it and brings it to her. She expects you to spread the word, or she'll be very disappointed and the last watchman that disappointed her mysteriously misplaced all his left shoes and now walks with a limp. [/GandalffladnaG]

33. The local lord or lady passes by, they want to know if you've seen any ghosts here lately. If you answer no, then they get angry and swear the old duke's ghost headed this way leading them towards the gold-no-wait-i-didn't-say-gold-you-saw-and-heard-nothing before they wander back in the direction they came from. [/GandalffladnaG]

34. Someone approaches you and they claim to be a famous long-dead admiral and they are seeking their fleet of warships. The nearest body of water capable of having a fleet of ships in it is a four week journey from here. If you tell them this information, they look at you as if they believe you to be stark raving mad and slowly back away from you before disappearing around the corner. They come back with a few deckhands a few days later, peering around buildings at you before consulting each other and peering at you again. One of the deckhands approaches you with a harpoon asks if you happen to be a giant whale in disguise. If you answer no, they look like the don't quite believe you, but say OK and return to their group, which stands around and talk with each other some more and occasionally peer back at you. If you answer yes, the deckhand becomes startled, and drops the harpoon before looking at you like you're the crazy one, pulls off their eyepatch as if they've never seen it before and wander off back to their regular life. A few days later you hear that a whale was killed while impersonating a guard on the other side of town. The admiral and his crew are not heard from again, leaving you wondering wtf is going on around here. [/GandalffladnaG]

35. A bearded lord in armor comes into town, he asks you where he can find a plant nursery. If you give directions to him he thanks you and goes to find the place. The next day he returns, asks you if there is a landscaping business in town. If you give directions again, then he thanks you, wishes you a good day, and goes on. The next day he comes back, asks you where he can find some armed men available for hire. If you give directions then he thanks you graciously, and goes on. The next day he comes back with a few armed men, stops by to tell you that he'd be damned if he had to cut down the mightiest tree in the forest with a herring, and knights you for your help in ridding the land of ""those foul so called knights"" and tells you if anyone ever comes by wearing a bucket helmet with antlers on top, you're to say 'it' at them until they go away. [/GandalffladnaG]

36. While on patrol one day you come across a small puppy. It whines at you until you pet them. If you try to leave without them, they whine and cry. If you take them home, the puppy starts digging a hole next to the back door of your home. After a week, the puppy drags an old bag out of the hole and over to you. Upon opening the bag you discover 15 platinum pieces and a magic ring. The puppy becomes your best friend for life. [/GandalffladnaG]

37. In the middle of a series of protests advocating for creature rights and welfare, a well-known monster-trading ship pulls into harbor, weeks ahead of schedule. You are one of the few on guard duty at the port. The crewmen, relieved to finally be on dry land again, tie up the ship to the docks and ask you to watch their cargo while they hit the pub. Should you refuse, you risk 1d3: 1) someone from the local creature-rights protest sneaking onto the ship and freeing the dangerous monsters in an act of rebellion; 2) a brawl with irate, hungry, sea-mad monster merchants who just want to go for a pint; 3) the loss of business from a major merchant, which would undoubtedly result in some choice words from your higher-ups, if not a week of hard labor. Should you accept their request, you chance 1d3: 1) a gift of a mysterious monster egg by the captain of the ship as payment, which once hatched will imprint on you like a duckling; 2) a hefty sum of gold; 3) the wrath of the local protestors, who then proceed to start a brawl with the port guards (equal to the # of your party + 2) [/Ziggyda1st]

38. One day you hear the faint plink of metal on stone. It goes on for hours and searching the area fails to reveal its exact source. Each day the plinking gets slightly louder and seems to get closer to the tower. After two weeks the noise seems to be coming from directly below your tower. A section of floor suddenly collapses. You can hear some excited shouting from the hole, in a language that you don't understand. It sounds like some of whoever or what ever is down there may be injured. [/World_of_Ideas]

39. A caravan passes through and ""drops"" a sealed box. You attempt to return it, but the caravan is already gone before you can. Curious, you open the box and (1d5): 1.) it's filled with gold; 2.) something pulls you into the box, transporting you to an eldritch realm; 3.) your body starts turning into wood; 4.) you've just unleashed a swarm of flesh-eating insects; 5.) you find a bloodied head that looks an awful lot like your superior (which raises the question of who you've been taking orders from). (Optionally: 6.) Bees!) [/Zetanite, bees by /thelefthandN7]

46. The night of a full moon a hunter (or poacher if hunting is restricted to nobility) from a local village who has been away for a few days comes screaming about how his son was taken by the wolves. The next day you hear rumors that his son has been found covered in blood but alive and relatively well, though clearly traumatized; the incident is blamed on the local fey whom the hunter must have upset. A few weeks later a detachment is formed to deal with an outbreak of lycanthropy within a nearby village. [/Admirable-Respect-66]

47. You endup playing witness to a rowing competition between a set of Dwarfs and druids, the Dwarfs are using a slab of stone they carved into a Viking long boat.

51. A playful kid imitates any mannerism or thing you do while on guard duty and sheepishly laughs at themselves or you based on the reactions and outcome.

7,"**EDIT: looking through the comments, you'll see a lot of ""smaller"" reasons. This list was intended as a way to explain the mage not helping against a BBEG or a cataclysm, which is how this will be continued. Feel free to look through the other ideas in this thread though!**

Every so often, you might want to give the party access to a highlevel mage or similar. Maybe because of RP reason, maybe to give the wizard an easier time finding the spells they want. This can be a problem when you introduce an extremely dangerous badguy. Fret no more! This mage can't help because:

1. They are dead
2. They are missing specific materials
3. They are actively holding up a spell that is already helping, thank you very much
4. They don't care about the problem because they are powerful enough to get away unscathed
5. They are somewhat responsible for the problem, noticed it and suddenly can't be found anymore
6. The enemy has leverage over them
7. They have feelings for the enemy
8. They are the enemy
9. They are dillusional and don't think the threat actually exists. When the Party manages to deal with the enemy, mage says ""see, told you it wouldn't be a problem""

11. As part of the enemy's preparation, they imprisoned the mage
12. One of the mage's experiments backfired, True Polymorphing them into a duck

38. They are a fraud. The real mage died some time ago and the fraud just assumed their identity. /World_of_Ideas)

53. They stumbled upon a deck of many things and found themselves trapped in a Demi plane after choosing just one. /PrinceOfAssassins)

10,"Its naïve to think that your PCs party of random adventurers is the only group in the world traveling on a quest, drinking in a bar, adventuring in a city or crawling through a dungeon. Lets build a list of groups a party may encounter with a composition of the party's members and their quest.

1. **Fifth Power Bards-** Twin Gnomes, one a singer the other plays the guitar, an Elf lute player, Human drummer, and Dwarven player of multiple brass instruments. This traveling group of musicians is seeking a upper-class or royal patron. They are building renown in smaller towns for now.
2. **Retribution for the Righteous-** A drunk Paladin that has seen too much, and Orc Ranger who owes a debt to the Paly. They are accompanied by a dozen sell swords along with squires, wagons and horses. They are working town to town to earn enough to keep mead in their cups and their gear in good repair. (secretly the Paladin is searching for a righteous quest to atone for a mistake he made)
3. **Treasure Hunters-** A teifling wizard, gnome fighter, human barbarian, elf cleric, halfling rogue and dwarf druid. They are searching for (or are found in) ruins or a dungeon that supposedly has a great treasure within.
4. **Lances and Dragons-** A Human Paladin, a Half-elf ranger, Elf-maiden Fighter all on Dragonback of Metallic dragons wielding long lances to fight midair from their saddles. They are on a desperate quest to prevent a great evil act from happening. When the party encounters them, they can either help or stand aside as this group cannot waste time while on this quest.
5. **The Black Hats:** A team formed around a sibling pair of bards who describe themselves as being on a mission from one of the gods of the setting. Their stated goal is something wholesome and understandable, but their tactics nose dive hard into Chaotic Neutral.
6. **The Ones Who Remain:** The last survivors of a frontier village terminated by an evil overlord, and their friends and allies. They've resolved to get payback or die trying, but are practical enough to do unrelated jobs to gather funds and resources. Alignment tends neutral, but may slide about depending on how well the campaign goes.
7. **The Furlough Boys:** An entire army unit from a near by kingdom. Currently between wars, they received permission to travel as mercenaries to keep their skills sharp and keep abreast of the current state of play in small unit tactics. Highly honorable (it's their honor *and* their kingdom's on the line), but push comes to shove will pick the fatherland over other concerns.
8. **The Ligitimate Traveler's Society:** A crew from a big city thieves guild, out in the countryside. They may be pursuing the Guild boss's orders, making their own action out of sight of the capos, or establishing bona-fides for some future shenanigans. Skews evil, though practical enough to not do anything too bonkers. Will rob you while you're asleep.
9. **The Traveling Show:** This large traveling group is a zoo, menagerie, circus or performing act depending on the place in your world that works. I has dozens of wagons worth of crew members along with the dozens of wagons worth of gear/animals/ equipment to perform the show. They travel around the world being paid by wealthy patrons or directly from cities to put on shows for weeks or even months at a time.
10. **The wheeled village:** This group of 100+ commoners of various races are gypsies who live in wagon homes and travel consistently. They never go into cities and rarely set up near towns or villages. Since they must always be on the move, the wagons and carts are highly customized and ready to move very quickly. Due to their constant travel, they breed some animals in cages but mainly live off what they can forage and trade for. If the party encounters them on good terms they have extreme rarities from all over the world to trade for mundane niceties and supplies. The group has secret motivations but for the most part try to avoid too much civilization
11. **Farmer with a secret:** This group of carts is led by a local farmer who is taking his crop to market. He has a half dozen farm hands that can easily defend their goods on the short travel. Within the goods he is taking to market lies a secret cargo that is the true reason for travel. If the party make successful deductions they may know that the crop isnt quite ripe, is undersized or is traveling a to a illogical city or port for sale.
12. **The marvelous miners:** This group of twenty miners are scouting for a new lucrative area to mine. They have several wagons full of gear and supplies to setup a mini mining town when that location is discovered. Secretly they are looking to find an ancient dungeon nearby that they heard rumor of. Their goal is to mine into this ruins and extract the hidden treasure without triggering the curse/waking the beast/dying from traps or other ill omen that was contained in the rumor.
13. **Dwarven Brigade**: Seven dwarves monster hunters. Professionals that can find and kill nearly any monster up to CR10 (mostly work against non sentient solitary monsters). They have a big cart with equipment to counter most monsters - from mirrors to mobile ballista. Party have one artificer-like magic user, cleric and five martials - sniper, super-grappler that can restrain small dragon, two ""defenders"" and ""ranger"".Ready to talk about monsters and share information with anyone who want listen (and buy drinks for group). Where they live, what habits and abilities they have, best ways to counter their abilities. What parts can be used to food, to armor and what best sell to wizards.
14. **The Swords of Dawn**: this group of nobles  want try adventuring life, fight against monsters, save towns and damsels. They are a Fighter, Paladin, Cleric and Wizard - all of them are middle-high nobility. They have the best equipment with rich decorations, small supply train of retainers and servants (without them nobles start complain about discomfort and savage situation - they don't have hot bath two days already!) Despite this attitude and their rich look this group is really good in combat and in organizing people - they study this from the childhood. Also have very strong idea that nobles need protect ordinary people and help them. Very honorable and always keep their oaths.
15. **Ciner'a's Bazaar:** This group can often be found setting up their trio of shops near the entrance of somewhat remote dungeons. Keka'le Ciner'a is a merchant first and a sorcerer second, and is willing to trade for or identify any item of sufficient rarity. Calder Herne operates as a makeshift cart-wright and smithy when he isn't practicing his samurai techniques. Lastly, there's Derorice Thurayya, who tends to sell salves and dream-catchers, despite her cheerful demeanor, she is a natural-borne dream-walker and is likely the strongest of the three by raw power alone.
16. **Perilous Pilgrimage:** This group of four consists of a Grave Priestess and her entourage, two mechanical guards and a servant. The Cleric, Taneli Buthanmah, has been tasked with eliminating taboo necromantic practices while her servant, Deis Rune, is more of a charge than anything else. Half of his body is covered in tattoos, and he relies on the cleric for emotional cues, reminders of his time left with a mad mage. The guardians are from an older, more violent time, where lesser evils were used to fight greater ones. Eternal Esutcheon weathered the eons through sheer will and defensive prowess, while Periobion seems to have skipped through time using less savory methods.
17. **Greed's Reprieve:** This party of three spends their time swapping out magical items with cleverly conceived replicas and fakes. Duran Stein, the brains of the operation, is a skilled burglar who was forced to rely on wits instead of his family's inherited magics. Quire, a naive copycat and forger who has run afoul of the church that trained her, itself an engine of grift. And then there's Ash, the smallest member and avid artificer/alchemist with an unnerving interest in mundane explosions, their backup for when things go wrong.
18. **The Mad Anglers:** Privateers aboard the ship ""The Silver Peregrine"" lead by Captain Pollux. Also includes a married couple Paladin and Cleric, both loyal to the goddess of Storms, and Gnome tempest sorcerer who is in well over his head. Can be friendly antagonists or work with the party as transport.
19. **Enforcer Squad Aleph:** a team of hired bruisers. Professional, curt, smart, and dangerous. No casters, but they are up to the gills with magic items. They always work for someone *extraordinarily* wealthy. Whether that person is good or bad, it's very good to introduce them as *incredibly* out of the party's league at first—then depending on how you want things to go, they will be a very helpful measuring stick if you ever let the party grow past them.
20. **Chuck's Pals:** a gang of gamblers and hustlers. They'll entertain the party with some fun games and will either run games that are house-favored by design (these the players might be able to win, but they don't mind because it hustles the average player so Chuck always wins eventually) or will outright cheat. If the party calls them out for cheating or get caught cheating themselves, a fight will break out (regardless of if they were or weren't).
21. **The Robbins Brothers** \- Five human brothers, all from a farming/ranching background. The three youngest, barely in their teens, are spellcasters (wizard, sorcerer, cleric) while the older two are martial classes (fighter, ranger). They’re on the trail of a man who killed their father. While their bodies look tired from travel, they all have a look of determination on their faces.
22. **The Heroes of Light** \- A group of young individuals of mixed races, all bright eyed and armed with standard adventuring gear. They have their quest; recover the Amulet of Bovis from the mighty smith Dalton. Dalton has the Amulet and is reforging it to keep away foul creatures. The PCs don’t need to make any checks to tell that these young adventurers are children armed with wooden swords, staffs, and a bow. Their quest is to get a cow bell from a smith.
23. **Heirs on the Run:** A group of siblings from a single noble family who fled when their ambitious sibling tried to secure the succession by having them killed. Most of them didn't want power anyway and are pretty content with their life (though they debate it a bit), but they stay alert for agents of their sibling coming to finish the job.
24. **The Brothers** \- A half-elf swordsman, a half-orc cleric (he can't seem to settle on one god), and a tiefling wizard. They claim to anyone who asks that they all have the same father, and certainly they treat each other with a level of familiarity and mixed contempt/admiration that speaks of family ties. If asked their quest, they claim to be searching for their father; the half-elf's mother is ill, and they want to drag their mutual father back to see her one more time. For bonus points, consider adding more hybrids to the group over time, as the Brothers find even *more* half-siblings (they may have to change the name at some point).
25. **The Otherworlder and Companions -** A human fighter, accompanied by a group of varied non-humans. The fighter claims he was born in another world, died saving someone else, and was reborn in this one. He claims to have incredible unique skills and is on a quest to complete his destiny. The rest of the group, however, claim their companion was hit with a particularly potent *confusion* spell; their quest is not to accomplish his destiny, but to raise enough money to have it dispelled.
26. **Last Request** \- A dwarf carries a tightly sealed wooden box on his back. His companions, also dwarves, are dressed in single, solid colors, their beards and hair in complex knots; a successful Knowledge check reveals that the colors and knots are mourning customs. The box contains the body of another dwarf, under a *gentle repose* spell. When he was mortally wounded in battle, he asked to be buried next to his father. Unfortunately, he came from a dwarfhold on the other side of the continent. The group adventures to make enough money to continue their journey across the continent so that they can fulfill his request.
27. **The Quiet Repose Inn** \- a group of mercenaries retired looking for a quiet place to open an inn with their wages and live out their lives in comfort. A cursed artifact causes the Inn, all the inhabitants and everything within a few hundred feet to be transported each full moon to a random location in the world (and possibly beyond). They recently were transported to the current location where the party now finds it.  The mercenaries seem oddly calm about the ordeal to and are immune to any dangerous effects of the environment if transported away from the material plane.
28. **The Dark Mirror:** A similar group of adventurers that closely matches your players and named as a strange facsimile or pun of their name. Adventurers that have very similar traits but small elements changed. Like one NPC could have the same class and race but different gender. Or there's a bard that's almost identical but has specialized in different instruments. Maybe they have all had very similar adventures. Almost like they could recount the entire campaign but the details are slightly wrong. They appear  almost but not quite doppelgängers and their intentions and response to the NPC group will also mirror their response.
29. **The Blacked Ones:** a group made of mostly humans and dwarves, all proficient in simple melee weapons and armed with pickaxes, shovels, hammers, picks, daggers or handaxes and with them is a simple cleric (could be any race). The reason they are called that is because they are one of the first teams to go to a mine and get dirty either in clearing monsters on just securing new paths and the reason they agree to this dirty and dangerous job is because it helps drive the economy and the pay is amazing due to the risk
30. **The Children of Sithrak the Devourer** \- two clerics of a chaotic evil god who travel the countryside preaching Sithrak's absolute hatred of sentient life. Weirdly, their theology often has the opposite result. Because Sithrak will condemn us all to an eternity of suffering, we should take our time and find joy in the little pleasures of life while we can. Facing Sithrak's scorn and hatred, we should learn to trust and rely on each other. It won't cost you anything to be nice to others now, especially since you'll be screaming in torment on the 6,784th layer of the Abyss until the end of time. Also, being the devourer, Sithrak has some pretty decent recipes.
31. **The Iron Communion:** good leaning paladin/cleric troop of religious extremists who attempt to covert anyone they meet with bible scripture and speeches. They focus of purging undead and will even do so without payment if the people asking seem like good people of faith.
32. **""That Bastard"" and his Friends:** This group is led by an antagonist who your party will learn to dislike or hate. It is led by a spoiled rich adventurer who could afford the best gear and best training. He has a team of adventures with him that are running parallel to the PCs mission and will often be one step ahead in the race to said goal. Secretly this antagonist is the actual hero of the prophecy or holds the clue, key or magical item to properly fulfill the quest.
33. **The survivalist crew**\- a bug bear, two kobold artificers a gnome mage, an orc and human fighter duo, a wood elf ranger and a halfling bard. The halfling is a content producer of a show made with their bug bear host ""bear"" Grylls, about adventuring and surviving in the wild. The kobolds act as the sound and film crew with the mage, and the fighters serve as security, and Road crew, the ranger is the actual expert on wilderness survival for the area. They are currently planning our their next recording while at 'camp'.
34. **Fraternity of the Circlet**\- this group is comprised of one half-elf, one elf, one dwarf, two humans and 4 halflings. This group has a secret mission to destroy an evil magical circlet in the fires of Mt. Ruin. Only one of the four halflings ever holds the circlet but he is very resistant to its magic. Another halfling is his best friend and likes to cook. The last 2 halflings are tricksters and pull pranks much to the parties detriment. One of the humans is a soldier and will try to steal the circlet. The other human is your quintessential wizard type. The half-elf is actually a prince. The dwarf and elf buck societal trends and are best friends.
35. **Monastic pilgrimage:** You meet a monk in his early twenties who is traveling around the region to various hidden temples to learn from the various masters at each temple. With him are two elven rangers who he has hired to help navigate and an old dwarven merchant that is supplying them with food for the benefit of security on the road and trade privileges at the temples.
36. **The Fair Maidens:** Four beautiful Maidens traveling in a carriage seem to be on a rebellious adventure. They appear naive and ill prepared for the common dangers of the road and they are quite flirtatious of anyone that meets them (male or female). Their only security is the middle age carriage driver. Secretly the four women are highly skilled adventurers who use this ruse to draw out bandits or other unsavory individuals that would take advantage of young women. Tending on the bloodthirsty end of the spectrum these four act as vigilantes with little mercy.
37. **Inventor and Beast-slayers:** A gnomish artificer along with two half orc fighters, a human ranger and a elven rogue. The gnome has put this group together to track and hunt down rare and dangerous magical creatures to extract expensive and useful components from the corpses. The gnome uses many of the components to make magical items, some of which are available for trade or barter. The group is willing to help other adventuring groups they come across if given total salvage rights of the creatures corpse and a negotiable percentage of other loot, if any is found.
38. **The Gang Below**\- A beholder paladin, an aboleth wizard, an umber hulk barbarian, a drow ranger , and a mindflayer psionic . All register as neutral good. They’re trying to prevent a great ancient evil buried underground from being released.
39. **The Knights of the Sacred Table-** a crazy middle-aged nobleman who claims he’s a knight, his kender girl squire who is desperately in love with him but he doesn’t realize, a female half-elven holy knight who wishes her fellow knights were a little less…quirky, a kindly pseudohuman aberrant armorlord hunter of men who would rip the skin off his back to keep you warm, a derro starsworn knight who believes the stars speak to him, a gnome paladin who finds this whole experience delightful, a half-orc knight out to prove himself to his human father , a womanizing half-rakasha samurai who prefers poetry and throatsinging to fighting, a thri-keen gladiator just glad to have friends, a soul-shell dedicate sworn to avenge his slain master, a hyu-zat fanatic determined to avenge his murdered family, an unspirited pretty soldier doing her best to keep the peace among these lunatics, a warforged crusader literally built for the job, a thaumurai dwarf who despises alcohol and prefers eating roast pork and potatoes, an okeli champion with a chip on her shoulder and a desire to win glory, and a changeling cavalier who hates shapeshifting, . This small army is currently carving it’s way through the army of undead giant monstrosities of the dread necromencer Aberghast the accursed who’s trying to reawaken the majority of his army of the unspeakable. As for why they’re all different races Aberghast, who is so solipsistic he can’t even imagine other races cooperating, set a gate to only allow one of each race into his domain at a time. If the players encounter them it’s going to be in Aberghast’s domains, which is like the Eberron Mournlands but with more undead giants and less creepy children.
40. The Ridiculous Creatures A reggelid wizard, a kender bard, a flumph paladin a draganborn barbarian, a warforged fighter, and a thri-keen ranger. They’re currently trying to assassinate a dictator who ordered the murder of “all ridiculous creatures”.
41. **The Montebank family-** Sir Reginald mountebank is a human monster-slayer and his wife Rebecca is a shifter rogue who was mistaken for a werewolf. They have two adopted children. Morris is a caliban fighter mistakenly blamed for several murders whose name Montebank cleared. Dear Lisa is a tamed Attic-whisperer. Grandfather is a talking skull in a bird cage that can cast divine magic and has claimed to be a god. Amiable is a Yeth Hound that swore a blood oath on his eyeteeth to “serve you for all eternity” in exchange for not being handed over to the crowd of children he spent the last three months terrorizing. When they are traveling he usually carries Grandfather’s cage in his disturbingly human teeth as he despises small talk. Reginald’s butler, chef, and sidekick Perecleus is a half-vampire charlatan formerly enslaved by a necromancer Montebank slew. Uncle Andy is a dread golem gunslinger built as a carnival attraction out of the skin of murdered children, an act for which he killed his creator four weeks after awakening. They are currently investigating a series strange murders in a town the party is passing through.
42. **The classics-** A party of 4 knights and a wizard off to slay an evil dragon and rescue a princess. They’ll share food, companionship, and stories with the party.
43.  **Faerun’s** ***Mightiest Heroes*** **-** Natalia, A female drow (or drider) rogue with fiery red hair, Sir Steven the Pure, A human paladin with a large circular shield decorated with stars, Bartlin Eagleeye - an elf ranger who was once regarded as the most skilled marksman in his kingdom, The Brute Bangor, an earth Genasi barbarian, Roth, an Aasimar fighter that wields a magical hammer imbued with lightning, and Professor William Weird, a divination wizard who wears a cloak of billowing and uses a glowing green gem necklace as a spellcasting focus.

A man on a ship feels  seasick, his vision swirls, and he faints, only to awaken on dry land in  the middle of the desert, surrounded by several other confused  foreigners. This is similar to magical summoning, but without a  summoner. These gates simply appear and transport people somehow,  somewhere. (by)

They  regain their memory of their pasts... and they all vaguely remember last  night. But... why were they in guard uniforms and armor? Why were they  in the.... THE KING'S CASTLE? Oh no... why were they at the heart of the  archmage's tower? And... what was in the vault? Who was that guy? They  now work together to piece together what happened, all the while  choosing to hide their true backstories, or come clean that they are not  a member of the guard. (by)

72. Originally you set out on an adventure, unfortunately at some point you  were petrified and turned into a statue. Years passed. Luckily someone  has come along and broken the curse, now you and a few others find  yourselves trying to get out of this museum. (by)
73. You have been hired as guards to accompany a carter and his stock to the  hold of one of the outer dukes, the amount of protection seams a bit  excessive, but you can hardly complain of a few extra coin when you were  heading this way anyway. Your three days out of Candle Breach, and the  memories of your crossing at the Bark Berry ford a few hours back are  quickly fading as the miles trudge past, though the gregarious greeting  of the ford keeper with their wide brimmed colorful hat was a pleasant  break to the clatter of cart wheels on dirt and stone. The sun and  steady rhythm of you steps play on your mind tempting your thoughts to  drift with the pleasant cool breeze, when suddenly with a blinding flash  of light, and the sound of the end of all worlds you are thrown to the  ground and the world goes black... Sight returns, your ears ringing, the  stench of burnt timbers and voided meat assailing your nose, your  trembling hands checking for injuries as you rise unsteadily to your  knees. The cart is gone, the carter, gone, the draft animals so much  mulched meat, a shallow crater filled with smoldering debris, and the  stunned expressions of, by sheer dumb luck, your virtually unscathed  companions, all that remains... (by-Cicada-5029)
74.  A ""Fallen Star"" has been spotted streaking across the sky and slamming  into the far off North. Nations, Guilds, and Armies gather teams of  explorers together to brave the harsh landscape and savage monsters to  race to the landing point and retrieve the ""Fallen Star"". Rumors spread  that it grants wishes, some say it's made of a metal harder than steel  and more magically amplified than any alloy yet in use. Some believe  it's a savage threat to the world and their God while others believe it  contains hidden celestials (and fiends) waiting for the faithful to free  them. The party is a group of adventurers hired by an old, erratic  explorer who wants to secure the Star for his museum. However, each of  the PCs have their own hopes for the star.  (by)
75.  You are all enjoying some time at the Zoo / Circus when each member of  the party spots a shady figure cast a spell, releasing a collection of  dangerous beasts/monsters on the patrons, before dimension dooring away.  The party is forced to fight for their life and save the other patrons. (by)
76.  The party is traveling together on a train-like contraption when it is  attacked by bandits / pirates. They work together to repel the baddies,  and the workers on the train wish to reward them with free upgraded  tickets to first class. Well, as they are settling into first class,  clerical error falsely forgets that first class is, in fact, not empty  and decides to split the train contraption, sending first class to a  different town / city than the party's destination. Depending on when  they figure it out, they will arrive at a different destination, given a  refund (of first class) for the trouble, and directed across the  dangerous wilderness to their true destination. Since they are all going  the same way, and there's safety in numbers, the party sets off to  their shared destination. (by)
77.  A famous criminal has broken out of a large prison and escaped into the  wilderness. This criminal has wronged each of the party in some way, and  when news reaches them, they angrily decide to head out and bring  justice to him, in whatever way they see fit. They all meet up on the  way to one of his old contacts to question them, and realize they are  all after the same guy. (by)
78.  A notable Cleric in a small town is on trial for crimes committed. Each  of the party has some sort of information on these crimes, and has been  persuaded to testify against them. The group is gathered and sent on  their way to the small town where the trial is to be held. Only, the  Cleric has many allies who might not wish for him to be locked up, but  also might not want a group of nobodies testifying to those crimes. And  bad things happen on the road all the time... (by)
79.  The party has been assembled in the lamp of a Djinni. He lets them know  in a moment, they will be released to aid a very bad man out of a  dangerous canyon, as he has wished for an escort through the dangerous  land. The Djinni does not wish for this man to escape to make more  wishes, so the party is his idea of a twist to this man's wish. The  Djinni tasks the party wish fulfilling the man's wish, but once he is  safely through the canyon, they must stop him or steal the lamp at all  costs. If the party succeeds, he bribes them with riches and magic  items. And POOF, the party is out of the lamp into a fight with a CRed  encounter and an angry looking Mage who is out of spell slots. (by)
80.  You are all attending the same parade when a public figure is being  brought down the street on a cart, waving. The party notices a  collection of Kobolds scaling the rooves of the nearby houses, and they  light arrows on fire and prep to fire them. A word of warning is shouted  out (preferably by a PC) and the figure narrowly avoids being hit by an  arrow. The Kobolds descend to the street in the chaos, making for the  cart. The party gets caught up in the fight against the Kobolds. (by)

83.  A collection of names is drawn from the Adventurer's Guild. The PC's are  among the lowest earners for the guild, and have fallen behind on dues.  They are all thrust out, together, into the night and told to either  pay off their dues (they all owe the same) or bring in an artifact or  trophy that will be a boon to the guild. (by)
84.  You all meet at a job board. All the single jobs stink at only a few  copper for a hard days work. However, one new flier promises plenty of  Gold pieces, but it requires a \[Party Size\] group of adventurers to  apply. The group realizes they would earn more doing this one job  together than doing all the other jobs combined alone. (by)
85.  The PC's (all of them) patron (Money wise, not Warlock) brings the whole  team together, introduces them, and then calls in a favor for each of  them. They have a big job, and it requires this collection of talents to  work together to complete. If they refuse to help, they will be cut off  from the Patron. (by)

88.  A Chaotic deity brings together the party on a cliff and announces that  they are being honored at a banquette as the worst people in the mortal  world. They are given a map and pointed to a mountain in the distance.  If they arrive and are honored, they will receive a magic item and 500  gold. However, they will accept they are the worst people in the world.  With that, the deity leaves. (by)

91. All  the PC's have died and are in line to be sorted into good or bad. A  malfunctioning modrons proves to be an Imp, who claims to know the way  back to the material plane for a cheap payment: knowledge of how you  died. The party agrees, and begins the escape to the material plane,  hunted by modrons trying to get them back in line to the afterlife. (by)"
12,"DMs will often include high-level NPCs (or at least higher level than the heroes) to give them quests. So why don't those high level NPCs do it themselves?

8. It’s not their turn,

1. They want to make room for the next generation of adventurers.

1. Something about the quest puts them in particular at a severe disadvantage. e.g. severe hay fever, for example, bad enough that they couldn't breathe well enough to fight, so they stick to the northern areas and are looking for someone they think can stand in for them.

1. They are in some way directly responsible for the threat; either they are the BBEG or are secretly a follower.

1. They are depressed because someone dear to them died/left

1. Too many other things to do.
1. The quest target would immediately recognize them, but the target doesn't know the adventurers, so their presence would not raise suspicion

1. The BBEG used to be their (friend, lover, sibling, child, mentor, apprentice). They can't bring themselves to harm them.

1. The quest location is cursed/sacred/some other reason, so they won’t go there.


I've skipped over duplicates or suggestions very similar to entries already on the list.

Thanks to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
13,"I'm drafting up a list of plausible company names that don't actually give any hint to what said company actually*does*. The purpose of this may just be fuller for world building, maybe these are shell companies for a criminal organization, maybe they're all subsidiaries for a powerful mega corporate conglomerate. To fit the style of what I'm looking for, each name should have at least two words in it (or one long name that consists of some nonsense words) and shouldn't refer to anything too specific. For example, Jim's Lumber Company is a name where you get pretty good idea of their business model. If it vaguely alludes to a particular industry but doesn't specify what said company does IN that industry, it's fair game. I'm mainly looking for something that could fit into a modern or sci-fi setting, but if you come up with a company that you think could also fit into a fantasy setting, feel free to list it. Bonus points given if you include a nonsensical company slogan or an idea for a corporate logo.

EDIT: WOW, this has really blown up! Thank you to everyone who's contributed, it was actually pretty difficult whittling this down to only 100 names! As some have already pointed out, my initial list contained business names that actually exist, it's surprisingly difficult to come up with an original name. I've changed some of mine and trimmed down my own starting list to make room for better suggestions. Here's out final list!

17,"# 1d100 only-slightly-mad wizard quirks.

1. Sometimes pages from your spellbook spontaneously fold into origami and attempt to escape.
2. Whenever a new spell comes to your mind, you hastily scribble it down on the nearest available flat surface, be it a page of an already written book, a wall, or an ally's shield.
3. You do not actually rest during long rests. The whole night is spent rehearsing spells.

11. When casting a spell with verbal components, you have an accent. You don't otherwise have that accent, however. \[By\]
12. You obsessively collect seemingly mundane, ordinary, nondescript pebbles. But not *all* pebbles. Most pebbles you pick up, look over, and contemptuously cast aside. Maybe 1 out of every 20 you keep, gingerly putting them into a felt pouch. When people ask what you're going to do with all these pebbles, you just smile and say, ""You'll see."" \[By\]

35. Preparing spells for you is as religious an act as a cleric or paladin beseeching their god for strength and power. \[By\]

62. Anytime you see a pattern that resembles a face, you believe it to be a real person. There are a lot of very rude people who staunchly refuse to talk to you. \[By\]
63. You are convinced that the stars are other far away wizards trying to communicate with you. You’ve been trying to figure out a way to talk with them ever since you realized. \[By\]
64. You’re never quite able to tell whether your dreaming or not. Throughout the day you perform a variety of little spells and rituals to attempt to discern whether or not you’re awake. \[By\]
65. For the longest time, you’ve been trying to convince your magical peers (or whoever will listen) that birds, fish and worms are all just variations of the same animal. \[By\]
66. You don’t trust birds. As such, you never open your spell book when it’s pages would be visible from the sky. \[By\]
67. Like how some people sleep walk, you sleep cast. On multiple occasions, you have awoken to your sleeping area fully reorganized based on dream logic. \[By\]
68. You actually tried to tattoo your spell book onto your body at one point. You still have the nasty magical scar. Turns out the human body is closer to a spell scroll than a spell book. \[By\]
69. You randomly mix spell structuring words into sentences. It does grammatically make sense, if you understand it. It’s the equivalent of saying half a line of code in a conversation. Other wizards *might* understand it, depending on how fluent they are magically and in the language. \[By\]
70. You can't stop explaining ALL the rules, history, and statistics to Marvelous Magical Marbles Maneuvering League to anyone you meet, including them as aphorisms of daily wisdom, and meticulously explaining how competing rules interpretations may be applied to non-Marbles-League life, and also how the sport differs in so many way from the Stupendous Sphere Sliding Squadrons Sport, which is a totally inferior sport. ALL THE RULES. \[By\]
71. Every time you cast a spell of higher level than a cantrip, you must first cast at least one cantrip for reasons of universal balance and vast significance that mundane mortals could never hope to fully comprehend. \[By\]
72. Why spend one gold, when you can spend 1d3? It is only gold, after all... and if it gets spent to further increase your wizardly power, it isn't wasted.. one gets what they paid for, after all. \[By\]
73. The biggest reason you’re a wizard is because your spell book (and weapon if bladesinger) is “possessing” your body, which will last even if destroyed because it’s actually fused with you due to a ritual in the past. \[By\]
74. You have a stutter which doesn’t effect the casting spells, but visually causes them to look as if they are lagging, stuttering, or skipping. \[By\]
75. You insist you are a cleric of Mystra and every spell you cast is a prayer to her. \[By\]
76. You constantly talk to your wand, giving it compliments or scoldings. \[By\]
77. Your hair changes color every time you cast magic. The color tends to be more vibrant when powerful spells are cast. \[By\]
78. Inspired by the great archmages of old you've decided to create your very own entirely new spell. You just haven't exactly figured out how it is supposed to work or how to cast it yet. Nevertheless, you insist it is only a matter of time before you learn its secrets. \[By\]
79. You've developed an unnerving level of fondness for trying to magically enchance blackpowder. As a consequence, your laboratory has exploded on at least 5 separate occasions. \[By\]
80. You've developed a taste for raw insects and earthworms after having spent 3 months polymorphed as a newt due to a slight mispelling of a spell once. \[By\]
81. You are convinced that writing your spellbook in a very specific way enhances the power of your spells (it does not). \[By\]
82. Casting any spells makes you start briefly cackling maniacally \[By\]
83. You keep having arguments with your shadow over mundane things like what to cook tomorrow for dinner. \[By\]
84. You are constantly paranoid about about some malicious entity trying to snuff out your genius intellect with the use of poison. Just to be safe you cast detect poison on any food or drink you eat whenever it is possible. \[By\]
85. For some reason all of your spellcasting verbal components come out as pop song lyrics, product jingles, and slogans for things that don’t exist in your fantasy realm. For example, the verbal component for casting Fly is “Come Fly the Friendly Skies”, and for Blade Ward is “duh nuh nuh nuh, can’t touch this”. \[By\]
86. You have a suspicion of all cheeses, especially the aged ones, as you have yet to disprove their sentience. \[By\]
87. You love to smoke, but only do so armed, just in case magical residue turns the smoke into an imp. \[By\]
88. Something about casting spells makes you feel slightly intoxicated. \[By\]
89. You CAN NOT resist a good deal or opportunity for free spell components. Regardless if it’s a spell you know. \[By\]
90. You get really sweaty after using magic. \[By\]
91. Using magic makes your feet really cold. \[By\]
92. You always wake up singing a song. This dictates the spells you know that day. \[By\]
93. You have an obsessive habit of testing any mirror you encounter no matter how small or large, making sure it's not a portal, life trap, or duplicate inside. Lesson learned. \[By\]
94. You constantly feel like there are tiny fingers pulling at your hands and face. Using magic makes it go away. \[By\]
95. You are irrationally afraid of spherical objects. \[By\]
96. You insist that all spells actually belong to your school of magic and that all other schools of magic are just lies. \[By\]
97. You attend arcane research conferences only to discourage other wizards from writing the topic you're planning on publishing. \[By\]
98. You believe that you're living in a time loop, but your memories get reset every time you wake up. \[By\]
99. You believe that upcasting your spells to a higher spell slot is a waste of your magical energies and it gives you a lot of anxiety whenever you do. \[By\]
100. If you have a familiar, you feel the need to change its form every single day to keep things fresh. If you don't have a familiar, you make do with a pet rock you change every day. \[By\]"
18,"**TLDR:** Need humorous things to post on a Notice Board. Not Quests.

Recently added a bunch to my game room, came across an old pinboard to pin up things and decided all quests found on a Notice Board in game will be there. Instead of constantly reading off what’s on the Board, players can now pick what they want and easily know what’s available. 

Decided to add a bunch of random things to the board as well to help bring the town they are in to life. Looking for funny things to post on it.

**Examples:**

1. Plow Elsewhere - “To the Couple fornicating in my barn at night, your constant banging, hooping & hollering is keeping me up at night. Kindly find elsewhere to Plow” 

2. Big Beefy Brute - “Single Female Gnome seeking an a Big Burly Orc to show what this Bigger is Better fable I keep hearing is all about.”

3. Matron Pleaser - “I'll satisfy any woman of mature years, no matter your age, race or appearance. Whether it's a toss in the hay or a witty conversation you're hankering, I'll deliver. Ladies interested in my company can leave a note with their address on this notice board. If a strapping young lad named Odrin comes a-knocking, that's me.”

4. Herbs for Embarassing Afflictions - Of late, as is often the case during tourney season, the incidence of diseases afflicting the nether regions has increased.
I can offer an ointment that will soothe all such unfortunate itching.

5. Fresh Goods! - “Tobacco, fisstech and liquor, from absinthe to everclear.
The customer is always right!
—The Girl Who Sells It All, formerly known as the Girl Who Sells Crops”

6. Pre-orders the new Mustang today!
At Ford farm, our mares have recently given birth, we are now accepting pre-orders of our mixed breed riding horses, available in a variety of colors, order today!

7. Hitman Wanted Kyle's mom is a big fat bitch. Need someone to hit her.  $20.
The twist: Contract was written by an idiot.  Wants someone to literally just slap Kyle's Mom.  Is not actually advocating for her Murder, as she's a mostly nice lady (if in a Karen kinda way).

8. Notice board postings now under daily review by town hall personnel, following a flood of complaints by someone simply identified as 'Karen' being posted on the board about minor grievances towards every person in town

9. WANTED: Empty Stomachs and Open Minds! Seeking taste-testers for meals based on unconventional food sources. No payment necessary and no risk of serious illness!

10. To the party of Adventurers in this region,
Please come and collect your friend Karl. He's been using your tab at the Tavern to eat & drink daily while waiting for you to get back. And we are tired of housing him.
P.S. Amount on Tab due is negotiable if you get him out before the rest of our wait staff quit.

11. Beware of the Bagman on a faded, torn up paper

12. HELP WANTED: Armor/Blade quality testers needed at [insert blacksmith shop]. Employment benefits and hours negotiable.

13. Have you been injured by fulfilling odd jobs posted here? You may be eligible for financial compensation! Come see _____, any time between noon and sundown.

14. To the drunk adventurer who left the Brass Koin early morning yesterday - we still have the cursed ring you used as collateral. We would sell it but no one will buy it. Come get it before it possesses another one of the waitstaff. Please bring real coin to settle your bill this time.""

15. Adventurer-to-be seeks party who needs a young brash fighter. I have no experiece but that means I have no bad habits with adventuring. The only catch is I have to come back home twice a year, no matter what quest I'm on. My mom insists.

16. A notice, written in a shaky hand, using coloured pencils…
Wanted: advendures needed to go on a qust to (aqkuire/akwire/aquir all crossed out ) get a doll from the dungeon of Sally.
Come to the farmhouse at the end of the main road and ask for Wilhelmina the 3rd.

17. Not a ""Wishing Well"" - Please stop throwing Copper into my well down by the sheep pen. That one is not magical and is only used to water the sheep and my family. The magical wishing well everyone speaks of is by the front gate between the hazel tree and the rock with the rune cut into it.

18. Nice River Ogre - The Ogre who just move to the river ford is nice and does not want to hurt anyone. He protects the area from wolves so the sheep are safe, but he asks that any Shepherd who want to graze there give him some fish (salmon is his favorite). He does not want to eat sheep by accident when he is hungry and want to live peacefully. Barzn'i asked me to write this for him because he doesn't know how to hold a human quill.

19. Free Remedy! - For those afflicted with Lonk Wart, mix 1 part crushed eggshells, 2 part Bronki Seeds, and 20ish part river mud together, smear over affected regions of the foot, and let it dry. Peel it off after a days work and within 1 to 2 weeks it should clear up. For more useful remedies, visit Lonia's Herbals and Brews!

20. WARNING! DO NOT...
The rest of the notice has been torn in off.

21. Help Needed: I knead sumbody ta talk ta da Notice Board Comitte.
Iz tired of dem taken down me notices. Dey seyz dey ain't important, but dats a lie.
Soz somebody kneads ta tell dem ta leave me postings up.
Extra gold in it iffin ya rough em up ta send da message.

22. Hiring self starters that want to get rich and join the newest financial empire! Learn how the inverted marketing funnel works!
*~It's a pyramid scheme.  They're selling Hide Leggings or whatever. Player can talk to their nearest rep and invest $500 to get $200 in leggings~*

23. Want the wealth of a lord? Invest $1000 today and we pay you $20 every week forever! Reclaim your original investment whenever you want!
*~Offer is legit.  Press $1000 onto the ad to make your investment.  Twist: It's a Ponzi Scheme.  At the end of every week roll 1d20.  2-20, pay the player $20 per $1k invested.  On a 1, the scheme has blown up and payments stop.  If they ever try to get their $1000 back, it's Insight vs DC 25 Deception.  On success, Roll the d20, less than 10 and their withdraw triggers the collapse.~*

24. Looking for Target for Hitman practice.  Hiring whoever reads this.
Once a player acknowledges reading it, the message disappears with a little green checkbox flourish indicating the contract has been accepted.

""Oh shit, is there a hitman coming after me now?""

:DM Shrug: ""Idunno....""

25. Pie Lady seeks new PieFaceMan!  enquire at Bakery!
(she just wants someone she can hit in the face with a pie.  It is how she deals with bad customers)

26. Lost: Owlbear cub. Answers to “Luna”.

27. Lost: pseudodragon familiar. Refuses to answer to anything other than “Lord Artimus the destroyer”. Please kill on sight.

28. Lost: +1 long sword; last seen in the grumpy goat inn. Has a minor curse.

29. BECOME A WIZARD TODAY!!! - The Great And Mighty Archmage Draziw is eager to pass on his VAST magical knowledge to a new generation of pupils, from the COMFORT of their own hovels. He is offering a correspondance course that is GUARANTEED to put the MANA in your WAND. To enroll, just send a letter with your address and two gold coins, addressed to Draziw the Wizard, mail address the FOX AND ASP TAVERN."
19,"I like playing as knights in games like Pendragon, and I like playing solo stuff in a vaguely 14th-ish century looking setting with Chivalric vibes that still has an internal logic for its names, so I made these two lists that draw names from medieval French, Chivalric literature, Latin / Late Roman names, and a couple Biblical names anglicised for mine, and now your, convenience.

I tried as best I can to maintain a certain logic in such a way that they might all fit togetehr in some cohesive way.

I didn't include unisex names because both Latin and French are very gendered languages, but nonbinary people can pick from any list.

You may also add, remove, or change letters as you wish, there's no real rule for these names. Ysole can easily become Isolt or Isolde, for instance. You can also add ""A"" or change an E, O, or -us to an A to turn any masc name into a femme name. So ntonius becomes Antonia, Atticus is Attica, Edmund becomes Edmunde or Edmunda (or Edmant, etc).

21,"I'm including a ""bargain item"" shop in my campaign where players have the option to buy wonderful things that are more than a little off at a discount price. Some should be curses, most just fun little ways to make great things a little less useful. Either items made by an amateur enchanter, student projects from an aspiring artifacer or items that are suffering the effects of previous owners. 

1. An immoveable rod that only holds for 30 seconds then teleports back to a holster.

2. A ""helpful"" hat of wizardry. Casts it's own cantrips whenever you fail to.

3. A dark shart amulet. Always casts prestidigitation when used to make you smell a bit off.

4. Hewards handy hangover sack. 1d3 pockets always produce a bottle of especially awful alcohol when used. 

5. Whistling ammunition. Whistles with report! Ranged ammunition that pops and knocks your target prone on a successful hit (DC12.) Until your next turn the first attack against you is at advantage.

6. Cracked Alchemy Jug - can only produce one of the liquids available to the standard Alchemy Jug (determined by the DM). The liquid dribbles out in 6 seconds (1 round) at the start of each dawn.

7. A used bag of holding. Leftovers from a prior misadventurer. Any nonmagical item placed in the bag becomes covered with glitter that was spilled inside at one point, decreasing it's value by 25% until cleaned thoroughly, taking 1d4 hours. The first time you turn the bag inside out, rotten food, broken weapons, and other misc objects accumulated over years are dumped out along with any contents you put in."

33. The fire. Oh my God there is so much fire. Why is the well burning?

45. The town crier, he has two heads and they are taking turns shouting the news and sipping from a flagon.

47. A number of market stalls, one of the vendors is a unicorn, she has a selection of herbs and spices.

48. The pleasant scent of baking bread. You seem to have entered near several bakeries, in the closest one you can see the baker just setting out some sweetbreads with fruit and honey to cool.

88. The first floor of every building is a shop or storefront of some kind, no matter how far from the market or main streets you go. Everyone is selling something.

94. Only the wealthiest buildings in town have windows.

96. The City Guard is dressed in bright scarlet colors: tunics, breeches, hats, and even the feathers officers wear in their helms and hat brims. No one else in the city wears red.

Homes are built so that the streams pass by the front doors and if possible surround the home like a moat. The water is clear and pure, and special laborers can be seen cleaning trash and detritus from the waterways.

101. Chalk dust coats nearly every surface seen. Most homes are covered in chalk graffiti, art, and written words. The jumble is chaotic, ever changing, and everyone seems to have a piece of chalk (often colored) hanging from a cord on their waist.

102. The streets are stunningly clean, and all refuse is immediately picked up.

103. Entertainers can be found at every street corner, ranging from acrobats and contortionists, to musicians and public speakers. None can be seen taking money however, though the local clergy can be seen with donative boxes.

110. The high pitched whistle of tops, with a couple of kids loudly counting out how long they’ve been spinning.

111. The street you’re on is completely empty save a group of street sweepers. Even they barely pay any mind to the group, beyond politely asking for them to move.

112. The facades of all the buildings facing the street are pristine and white-washed. Looking at the back alleys reveals a much more ordinary level of care. (Thanks to flyingace1234 for nos. 105 - 112)

113. A line of tied and kneeling prisoners being summarily executed outside a smoking building. The guards will brusquely tell you that the prisoners are cultist rebels and you should move along. (Thanks to Brogan9001)

114. A huge board filled with 'wanted' posters, ranging from petty crooks to legendary bandits.

115. The low walls of ice all around you. Or was this road just dug out from the snow?"
23,"When facing an opponent, whether it be bandits at a crossroads, goblins scuttling in a cave, or a dragon landing in a clearing, it's clear that combat's gonna come quick. But the bad guys probably have enough time to shout a one-liner to kick things off.

3. Ring of intensive purposes. 1 free advantage, at will, per long rest.
4. Horn of beckon call. Either sends a message at any distance to any plane to an ally you wish to ask for help, or forces an enemy in sight to move towards you for 1d4 rounds.
5. (When encountering the French): potions of eeling. Advantage on wisdom survival for fishing eel. /gian\_key](
6. Boatswan. Summon a magical swan with profession (boatswain) at 20 ranks and 5 intelligence.
7. Key of skeleton. A reverse skeleton key that locks locks. /mrmonti](
8. Keeper of the bees. Summon a magical bee swarm, use them to keep the peace.
9. Sword of light. Weighs 1 tenth of expected weight. /redactedfractal](
10. The bag that holds. Cursed item, roll DC20 vs grapple to remove hand, check daily. /0oo13oo0](
11. Cloak of elevenkind. Take any roll, once per day: it was actually an eleven. /flutterwander](
12. The Case & Point: a collapsible spear fully contained within a small box. /ofcbrooks](
13. Fencing Sword: Requires attunement, Once a day you can cast wall of stone using as an action. If you do so the wall is made of wood instead of stone, and is vulnerable to fire damage. /cybermage99](
14. Attuning Fork(A tuning Fork): (requires attunement) Hitting this fork against an item that requires attunement causes the Attuning Fork to instantly unattune and the hit item to attune to you. If you attempt this on an item that is already attuned to someone, you must first hit the item with an attack roll then make contested charisma checks. If you win the check the item attunes to you instead. If used on a cursed item, that prevents unattunement the Attuning fork instead lets out a piercing note and becomes unusable for 1d4 days. /cybermage99](
15. Aware wolf figurine( A werewolf figurine): As an action summons a wolf with a 20 intelligence, wisdom and charisma. The wolf can speak all languages. The wolf functions as a commune spell with significant but not omniscient awareness of the situation at hand. The wolf lasts until all 3 questions are asked and answered before reverting to smoke. The figurine can be used to summon this wolf again after 2d4 days. If the wolf dies before it finishes answering questions the figurine becomes nonmagical. /cybermage99](
16. Memory Foam Pillow : A pillow which is surprisingly uncomfortable. A creature that sleeps on this pillow has a advantage on history checks the next day. If the user has been affected by the modify memory spell, the real memories are restored. /cybermage99](
17. Ring of 3 Wishes: Inscribed on this silver ring are the names of three NPC’s chosen by the DM. Each of the NPC’s has a wish inscribed upon the ring. If all three wishes come true, the user can cast the wish spell once. After the spell is cast, then names of 3 new individuals appear on the ring. Hidden fact: if an NPC dies their name is removed from the list and replaced by a new one with a different wish. The wishes always are divided such that one wish belongs to an evil creature, one to a good creature, and one to a neutral creature. /cybermage99](
18. Wet stone (Whetstone): This stone is perpetually dripping a small amount of water. Over the course of a day it will have produced 1 liter of water. If the stone is cracked open it summons a water elemental that is hostile towards all creatures it can see. /cybermage99](
19. Arcane Vibe Rater (arcane vibrator): when activated wand vibrates at different speeds based on the magical auras. While holding the wand you can use an action to detect the presence of magic within 10 ft of you. If magic is detected you know what schools of magic are present but not their sources. The wand does not discriminate known items meaning it often triggers off the other items the user holds. (I bet the bard buys this one first) /cybermage99](
20. Divine Vibe Rater (divine vibrator): when activated this ""wand"" vibrates so fast that it blurs, becoming an illusory divine figure (one that seems somehow a little voyeuristic and perverted, in ways that only make sense to the viewers mind). This illusory NPC will now follow the party, occasionally rating the vibe - especially if there are performances or other interesting skill checks occurring. Vibe checks, normally considered subjective, are totally objective as they are divine in source: the divine connection of the figure being whatever god the caster worship.
21. Wand of High Touch Ee. Use of this wand can alleviate ailments and states such as fear, panic, confusion, and hysteria.
22. Mute-Point: a magical spear - upon a successful hit does 1d6 piercing and silences the target for 10 rounds. /ofcbrooks](
23. A salt rifle - a tiny rifle used to shoot down bugs with salt. 1d4 vs insects only. Double damage vs swarms. Bonus action if target still alive after shot. /farysmally](
24. Belt of poisson resistance, makes you immune to fish. /mamayop](
25. Hand of Becca - the mummified hand of a barmaid named Becca. To attune, one must cut off their own hand and place the Hand of Becca to the wound, where it will attach itself. Once attuned, the user can cast Create Food And Drink three times per day, but only to create bar snacks and beer. /landsharkitect](
26. Wand of disintegrating. When used, the wand crumbles into dust. /consta135](
27. Bag of Hoarding. The bag weighs twice as much as all of the items inside of it. /dasandwichlord](
28. Elven Petal-stool of Roses: a small backless seat made entirely out of rose petals. /ofcbrooks](
29. Tangerine of dancing Queen. Advantage of performance (dance) for 1 hour after eating.
30. Fromage ala Astral Projection. As the saying goes, sweet dreams are made of cheese. Eating this allows the user advantage at will on up to 2 rolls in their next astral projection.
31. Scroll of summon escape goat. This goat will IMMEDIATELY attempt to escape upon being summoned, finding safe routes through whatever terrain. Goat has +25 to any rolls affecting it's ability to escape.
32. Potion of piece of mind. A common snack sold in Illithid vending machines, how this found it's way into the market you have no idea.

39. Amulet of Poissondistribution resistance. (Say the word distribution quietly, quickly, and NEVER acknowledge it).

67. Panpipe of Cinnamon. Every time the bard makes a synonym that makes the DM laugh, or at least smile slightly, the panpipe loads 1 (one) unit of magic missile bolt.

82.  A frayed knot. Activating this enchanted but innocuous looking piece of worn rope allows the player to cancel the effects of any single dice roll. It could be an attack roll against your character that critical hit for massive damage (you have to cancel the action immediately, otherwise the best you could do if you allow the damage to be rolled would be to cancel the damage die and force a re-roll), or it could be used to cancel... anything. It can only cancel the last rolled thing. Think of it like the 'nope' card from Unstable Unicorns. Once per long rest yada yada yada 
83. Lucky Wolf's Foot. Allows you to Paws Time. This acts as the classic spell timestop but all canine type creatures (dogs, wolves, werewolves, gnolls, etc) are free to act for 1 round. The first creature to take offensive action cancels the effect.
84. Cursed bow of Astronomy. +5 to knowledge Arcana, but all critical hits are now doomed to fail as the arrow flies over the targets head.

25,"The Book of Vile Darkness is an artifact in DnD dating back to the days of Gary Gygax, first cropping up in 1979 (as far as I am aware). The book was originally written by Vecna, though other sinister mages who have gotten their hands on it since his ascension to godhood have added their own vile spells, rituals, and pieces of arcane history. Incidentally, it's also going to be popping up very soon in my DnD campaign, and I'd love to have a list of 100 things that could be in it should my players choose to delve deep into it's sinister bindings. I'll start us off with the first 9, and y'all can help me fill it in.

1. The book contains information on the proper casting of the ritual to transform one's own self into a lich, including the process of crafting a phylactery, and the best ways to conceal it to ensure your continued survival.
2. The book contains a cook-book style guide on how to craft the best flesh golems, including what meaty bits of what creatures to use, a precise measurement on how much arcane energy should be pumped into the body, and exactly where to connect each piece (like meat Legos!).
3. The book contains the true names of a vast array of devils, yugoloths, dragons, fey, and other creatures with the belief that knowing a being's true name gives you power over it.
4. The book contains a section which acts as a zoological research guide regarding various eldritch horrors from the far realm. There is a clear purpose, intelligence, and intent to the writing, but 90% of it is just nonsense, buzz words, and technical jargon indecipherable to anyone who doesn't already have a grasp of the field.
5. The book contains one of the last remaining guides to casting a 10th level spell, a class of magic forbidden from being cast by the sovereign governing powers of the modern world. The spell requires vigorous preparation to cast, an exorbitant casting time, and an incredible toll on the caster's body, but the end results can be absolutely devastating should it be properly performed.
6. The book contains a slew of curses crafted from a slurry of words in infernal, abyssal, and sylvan dialects, with a range of effects bordering on cruel pranks to serious disfiguration of your enemies, and everything in between.
7. The book contains the means to traverse and map out the Domains of Dread within the shadowfell, revealing clear-cut pathways connecting places like Barovia and Lamordia together which otherwise would be impossible to identify.
8. The book contains the means to craft a tincture which acts as a love potion, though less in the vein of ""true love and happiness"" and more the in the vein of ""obsessive devotion bordering on ritualistic worship"".
9. The book contains a section that magically writes and rewrites itself with the passage of time, containing an innumerable number of *longggg* lists detailing every single immoral, unscrupulous, and downright vile thing each high ranking political figure globally has done over the course of their entire lives, with timestamps.
10. The book contains a detailed, extensive, and convincing philosophical dialogue asserting the moral superiority of self-interest, might-makes-right, and willingness to disregard societal norms to pursue one’s goals. This is often one of the first passages the book’s infinite pages show to a new holder, and the author of the dialogue is listed only as “Myself”.  Inspired by
11. The book contains an entire section devoted to cannibalism, giving information on how to properly prepare the meat of your own species for consumption. It looks like it was initially a small section devoted solely to humans, but has slowly evolved over many hundreds of years to include a vast selection of recipes and notes critiquing past authors, going through nearly all the various sentient races of the world. Inspired by
12. The book contains an Ikea-style guide on creating an innumerable amount of torture devices, each more devastating than the last. Devices include (but are not limited to) nerve pullers, barbed nerve extractors, trepans (skull drills), dermatomes (designed to harvest sheets of skin), etc. etc. The majority of these devices include side sections detailing how to infuse them with restorative magics, healing or reviving the victims to artificially extend the torture duration. Inspired by and
13. The book contains a discussion piece weighing the pros and cons of various soul trapping methods, reading like a well-written review judging and evaluating several products made for the same purpose. Methods include but are not limited to soul dissection, a night hag's soul bag, infernal soul coins, etc. etc. Inspired by and
14. The book contains, oddly enough, sheet music for a song called the ""Caelum Dolor Maximus"" (Heaven's Greatest Sorrow in Latin). The song is beautiful, and can automatically corrects itself on the page to be readable by any musician for their preferred instrument. The song was written by an imprisoned fallen angel, and details their fall from grace. Performing the song requires a high DC Performance check to play, and forces all who can hear it to make a high DC Charisma saving throw. Failure of this saving throw drives people into deep states of depression, eventually leading to suicidal ideations. Inspired by
15. The book possesses one, and only one, page with various fractal patterns drawn onto it which appear similar to the letter S. They are clearly drawn with purpose and intent, and *seem* important. Viewing this page serves as a memetic hazard affecting the subconscious mind; you are compelled, perhaps without even realizing it, to draw the very same S-like shapes on other pages you view or documents you write, which have the same contagious effect on others. This effect is incurable, and permanent. Inspired by
16. The book contains various scientific articles from different time periods and geographic regions postulating on the most effective means of eliminating all life in the multiverse in the shortest amount of time possible while also expending the fewest resources. Inspired by
17. The book contains a scrawled out note, in big letters, sort of a reminder for some malicious mage who held this tome previously. In hastily scribbled text, it reads ""DON'T FORGET: HEALING SPELLS CAN BE COUNTERED"". Directly under it, in smaller text, it says ""that means revivify too!!!"". Both notes are underlined several times. Inspired by
18. The book contains a detailed guide to psychological manipulation. The earlier portions of this section are effectively a textbook description of malignant narcissism rephrased into a how-to manual, but later on it gets more extreme, explaining how to trigger Stockholm syndrome with 98% effectiveness, how to break a servant’s self esteem and ambition without hamstringing their capabilities, and even an algorithm to determine whether a given atrocity is more likely to break the spirits of the oppressed masses or trigger a revolt.  Inspired by
19. The book contains an incredibly vast list of baby names with the most rude, cruel nicknames for each name listed beneath each one.  If you look up your own name, you must succeed on a high DC Wisdom save or become stunned as you are wracked with childhood trauma. You make remake this save every minute, ending the effect on yourself on a successful save. Inspired by
20. The book contains a massive ink blot, similarly to a Rorschach test. Gazing upon it and attempting to discern it's shape brings up traumatic memories repressed throughout your life. Attempting your first long rest after gazing upon the Rorschach test fills your dreams with nightmares of the aforementioned traumatic events, preventing you from receiving the benefits of a long rest for that night and giving a point of exhaustion to yourself. Inspired by
21. The book contains what is, more than likely, the largest repository of knowledge on poison crafting in existence. It lists out materials, costs, where to find each ingredient, and of course how to combine these ingredients for the most potent effect possible. Inspired by and
22. The book contains scientific research on what is, in most societies within the realm, considered the ultimate sin: the killing and dissection of celestial beings. Inside you find information detailing the various organs, body composition, and a complete anatomical map of an angel's muscular and bone structure. It further goes into information regarding ""scientific tests"" on various celestial's resilience and regeneration levels when exposed to certain negative stimuli, to include blunt force trauma, the flaying and removal of flesh and organs, and the effects of poisons or diseases on their bodies. Inspired by and
23. The book contains several advanced version of certain enchantment spells, namely those with the ability to impose dominating effects. These upcast versions of these spells are indeed more powerful and potent than their typical sibling spells, but take a greater toll on the caster than just a spell slot; they, slowly, carve away pieces of the caster's humanity. Inspired by
24. The book contains a slurry of arcane runes of infernal and, interestingly enough, giant origin, which can be inscribed into the deceased bodies of your foes. This serves a number of uses, to include preventing revival or resurrection, binding the soul of another creature to the body, or turning the decaying cadaver into a ticking time bomb. Inspired by
25. The book contains a cookbook of feasts made to impress extraplanar visitors whom travel to your abode. While it *starts* harmless, detailing the best ores to bring for dao to snack on or how to properly prepare sushi for a marid, it quickly devolves into controlled mania, detailing how much infant blood to pour for each glass at a feast for devils, the exact temperature your home should be at before you host an ifrit (spoiler: it'll kill you!), and eventually just random eldritch psychobabble for the section of slaadi. Inspired by
26. The book contains information on how to create summoning circles, not for extraplanar beasts or eldritch powers, but for people on the material plane. With this, you could kidnap any person from anywhere, regardless of how well defended they are. There are additional runes which can be placed into the summoning circle to generate additional effects. Just make sure you don't go too crazy on the runes; if they conflict, it could have gruesome results... for the purpose you're summoning. Inspired by
27. The book contains a built in defense, a trap of composed of a blot of ink which threatens to suck those into it who do not have pure evil in their hearts. It is unclear how to remove those who are absorbed into the blot from the book, or even where it is they go. Inspired by
28. Similarly to the prior notation, the book contains another trap, though this one is specifically designed to inhibit inhabitants of mechanus who may seek to destroy the book. It reads like gibberish, equal parts Shakespearean writing piece and insanely elaborate mathematical equation. This has absolutely no effect on flesh and blood beings, but constructs who read it lose control of their logic core, delving into a state akin to madness before finally suffering the effects of what is essentially a Power Word: Kill spell. Inspired by
29. The book contains many dark spells lost to time, the vast majority of which have had sections of them worn away to the point they'd be impossible to replicate, though *some* do still remain. The *Veins of Tar* spell is a 4th level transmutation spell available to sorcerers, warlocks, and wizards, which (as an action) instantly transforms the blood of your target to hot molten tar. The spell forces a target to make a Constitution saving throw, or begin taking 1d12 fire damage as well as having their movement speed halved. This spell requires concentration. Inspired by
30. The book contains a live devil of *decent* renown and power trapped within ink. The devil has been there for centuries and is desperate to get out, though his tricksy and malicious nature has been accentuated by the dark dealings of those he has been forced to interact with each time the book is opened. Perhaps finally dealing with kinder souls such as your party's will soften his heart? Inspired by
31. The book contains a disjointed collection of pages scattered throughout. Each page is arcanely enhanced with divination magic and precise geolocation capabilities, revealing to the reader every single awful, inhumane thing that has happened in the particular regions it correlates to in the last year in vivid detail, including specific names. Inspired by
32. The book contains a large number of pages which appear to be a diary. At some point in the book's seasoned history it seems a demon got ahold of it. The demon is of no real renown or significance to the world, and how it got access to the book is a mystery. The sadistic abyssal ramblings go into excruciating detail about various murders and atrocities and tortures the demon had committed over it's life. Inspired by
33. The book contains many dark spells lost to time, the vast majority of which have had sections of them worn away to the point they'd be impossible to replicate, though *some* do still remain. The *Malignant Light* spell is a 5th level evocation spell available to clerics and paladins. This spell can be cast as a reaction to a creature casting a healing spell on a target, transforming the total amount of healing done into necrotic damage. The healing spell initially cast can be of a level no greater than 6th. Additionally, you can cast this spell as a response to your own healing magic. Inspired by
34. The book contains information on performing a ritual which the world largely believes to be impossible, allowing you to artificially create the virus needed to convert creatures into vampires. What makes this so interesting is it does *not* require the presence of another vampire, and there is no thrall period; the ritual is perfected in such a way that allows for immediate high-grade vampirism night instantaneously. Inspired by
35. The book contains research on various elder evils, primordial beings of pure entropy which threaten the existence of the multiverse at large. It seems like the original researcher went a step beyond this however... it seems they were postulating and hypothesizing on means to bring the ones identified to be closest to our plane of existence here, either to extract their power for themselves, or to commit mass genocide on a planar scale. Elder evils include Atropus, Hadar, Father Llymic, and Pandorym. Inspired by
36. The book contains (what seems to be) the *true* story of Graz'zt, Demon Prince of Indulgence. Starting from his life prior to his death and rebirth in Hell, it appears to be a rather well detailed biography of his early days as a devil, his true reasons for defecting to the Abyss, and his true thoughts and feelings regarding Iggwilv, the witch-queen who bound him to her service and with whom he sired children. Such information could be damning to him and his conspirators within the hells who actively plot against Asmodeus.
37. The book contains a very large chunk of pages that have been cleanly removed from within. This would not be strange, if not for the fact that pages which are removed are immediately replace by new blank pages, showing the book's infinite nature. From what little remains of these pages, you can see detailing regarding the abyss and it's inhabitants. Perhaps information on a demon lord, or a hidden layer Demogorgon or Orcus wish to remain that way? Regardless, the pages appear singed by arcane fire, preventing their regeneration. Inspired by
38. The book contains a beautiful poem, a soliloquy commemorating the rise of Asmodeus, the Horned King, into the realm of divinity. Reading the poem aloud causes one to witness that very event, in all it's infernal glory. Perhaps coincidentally, one of the book's previous owners was found dead, eyes burned out of his sockets, with the book opened to this page. Inspired by
39. The book contains a yugoloth's bounty list. It appears that the majority of creatures on this list are warlocks who broke their infernal pacts or devils whom those same warlocks are looking to be freed from. The prices listed by many of them are enticingly large, and all list ""DEAD"" as the broker's preferred end status. Each time a creature on the 100-name-long list perishes, a new contract soon takes it's place. Killing a creature on the list immediately transfers the funds to you directly. Inspired by-Lee-Gio
40. The book contains an entire section devoted to a former author's ridiculously bad fanfiction, detailing a high fantasy erotic romance plot between in which the reader is in a love triangle with Asmodeus and Ygorl, Lord of Entropy. The fan fiction, regardless of it's atrocious subject matter, has innumerable misspellings, is grammatically incorrect, and contains several glaringly obvious plot holes. Inspired by
41. The book contains, stitched into it's flesh-colored pages, and immaculate treatise writ onto parchment crafted from the golden trees of Celestia. The treatise details numerous things, chiefly among them the good aligned deities list of conditions that would need to be met before Asmodeus would be allowed to to call upon them to aid in ending the Blood War. Players who have a good deal of knowledge regarding the Blood War will be among the first to realize that the the conditions have all been met, many many centuries ago. The treatise has been hidden here, lost to time, in an effort to prevent Asmodeus from receiving aid. This could change everything. Inspired by
42. The book contains what appears to be a treasure map writ upon tanned human flesh and nailed through several pages in the book. The map seems to lead to some ancient lost treasure hidden by an infamous dreadpirate decades ago. The lands depicted on the map appear strange, with odd topography and naming conventions. A character who succeeds on a high DC Arcana check is able to properly identify that the map depict a section of the planar cosmology unfamiliar to most, up to the DM's discretion: either the Nine Hells, the Abyss, Gehenna, Limbo, or the Far Realm. Inspired by
43. The book contains a lengthy passage written in an archaic and lesser spoken dialect of infernal, barely legible to most modern speakers. A literate speaker of infernal who succeeds on a high DC History check can discern, with some difficulty, that this is an ancient manuscript detailing to new archdevils the process of writing powerful binding contracts facilitating and governing the exchange of souls.

44. The book contains many dark spells lost to time, the vast majority of which have had sections of them worn away to the point they'd be impossible to replicate, though *some* do still remain. The *Soul Grinder* spell is a 9th level necromancy spell with the potential to completely destroy a creature's soul, destroying them on a level thought impossible by most scholars. This spell is available to clerics and warlocks. As a reaction to a creature you can see within 50 ft. of yourself perishing, you may begin casting this spell, which takes 1 uninterrupted minute to perform. Successfully completing the casting of this spell immediately destroys the target's soul, preventing resurrection, reincarnation, and ascension to the higher and lower planes. Casting this spell has a steep cost; an emerald worth at least 1000gp, and a fragment of your own soul. You can cast this spell up to three times in your life, and upon completing your third casting you die instantly, unable to be resurrected as your soul is destroyed entirely. Inspired by
45. The spell contains a list of dark rituals crafted by an author who claims to be Iggwilv, the Witch Queen. The rituals are extensive and strange, all written in a dialect of sylvan primarily spoken by hags, and are absolutely vile. Some of the more interesting rituals within this section include a curse to spread painful misfortune across an entire bloodline, a ritual to convert someone the caster loves into pure arcane energy and use it to boost their own magical potential, and a ritual to summon some far realm horror referred to both as a Dros'khanar and a ""Void Dreadnought"", described as a terrible amalgam of broken bone, twisted flesh and shadow from the space between worlds. Inspired by
46. The book contains a single question on a page, with two checkboxes beneath saying ""yes"" and ""no"" respectively. The question asks ""Do you wish to know what more you could be?"". If answered yes, visions of every possible life better than your own you could have lived floods your mind in less than a second, before immediately leaving. Though not physically damaged, such visions destroy any joy you may have had, leaving you to realize how cruelly unfair reality is that you could not be the best version of yourself. You gain the flaw ""Life is unfair, so why try? Nothing I do is right anyways."". This flaw is removed upon being targeted by a Greater Restoration spell. Inspired by
47. The book contains a subsection that looks like it was, at least at one point, connected to the flesh golem section, before more and more pages filled the space between the two. The subsection contains the precise surgical practices required to extract an intact nervous system from a living humanoid, or rather extricate that humanoids flesh, bones, and viscera. The subsection then explains, in gruesome detail, the science behind how the incredible pain an exposed nervous system is constantly in can be used to power enchantments that animate golems, greatly increasing their ferocity as well as their durability. Inspired by
48. The book contains a chapter discussing the metamorphoses from good to evil as a graph theory problem, where each node on the graph represents a moral dilemma, paradox or compromise that tests the subject's morals (with test results shown from previous tests). The chapter ends with a theorem postulating that a path from absolute good to absolute evil exists for any subject, but the parts with the formal proof have been scratched out. Perhaps you aren't the first people with good in their heart to find this horrid manuscript? Inspired by
49. The book contains instructions and research on what seems to be attempted improvement on the classic chimera creation process, including a ritual that can surgically and conceptually combine two beings into a single creature under the caster's control regardless of creature type. The minds of both creatures are kept entirely intact inside of the bodies while a gestalt enslaved consciousness pilots it at the casters will. The experiments of what happens when two diametrically opposed beings are combined, such as celestials and fiends, are truly maddening. Inspired by
50. The book contains many dark spells lost to time, the vast majority of which have had sections of them worn away to the point they'd be impossible to replicate, though *some* do still remain. The *Temporal Loop* spell is a 9th level transmutation spell with the capacity to turn even the most beautiful moment into a prison. This spell is available to sorcerers and wizards. Over the course of 24 hours, you can cast this spell to create a time loop in a selected area no larger than 5 miles. Over the course of these 24 hours you forge a diadem of pure temporal energy, using a casing crafted from pure sapphire worth no less than 3000gp. The diadem is diamond shaped, and about as large as a fist. The time loop ranges from 12am on the day the diadem is hidden within the center of the 5 mile area, going up until 11:59pm the following night. Each day when creatures within the area awake, they perform the same duties they did the day prior, feeling a strange sense of deja vu. If a creature chooses to make a check to attempt to identify the effects, they must instead succeed on a DC 25 Wisdom saving throw. A success on this save allows the creature to properly identify they are in a time loop and that they must break free to continue unto the next day, while a creature who fails cannot realize this (even if informed by another creature who did succeed), they can remake the save each following loop until they do. To end this spell, a creature must destroy the diadem, which has an AC of 18 and 50 hit points. The diadem is immune to divination magic used to determine it's location. Creatures which leave the time loop before the diadem is destroyed are returned to their same position in the time loop the following day. Inspired by"

They have rigorous training: close to a decade of war tactics, weaponry, economics, logistics, survival, hunting, and command experience before seeing deployment. They negotiate to have a lieutenant-equivalent rank in the army they assist. Several retire out to become advisors to kingdoms. Highly prestigious, expensive, effective. Mostly selected from orphanages, homeless kids, and the like, they can be seen as a vehicle for social mobility. (See Grey Knights from WH40k. Bonus points to listen to ""Passing of the Grey Company"" by Summoning.)

10. The Iswi Merchantile Company - a ""grey market"" alliance of traders and their allies that sells almost anything for a price. Not typically engaged directly in military operations, they nevertheless provide logistics, procurement services, consulting, entertainment, and legal-ish goods. Their motto is ""Sell to the best, steal from the rest."" They offer VIP bodyguard services and captain-level commanders for training or operations for a steep fee. 

11. The Skaalgriss - mercenary band of berserkers and shock troops. Specializes in camouflage and guerrilla tactics. Their homeland has repelled over a dozen attempts by various enormous nations due to the massive waves of guerilla sabotage and fighting that demoralize and shatter troops. Motto: ""Flick like a whip, vanish into mist."" 

12. The Silent Movement - Not direct mercenaries, they instead insert themselves into an enemy's supply lines and crafting guilds. Using sabotage, theft, weaponized incompetence, accidents, etc., supplies to battlefields are disrupted. (See the CIA Simple Sabotage Field Manual for more info.)

13. The Flayed - Specializing in shock attacks, these soldiers wear leathers and cloaks of sapient races' skins. The more exotic skins they collect get work as cloaks. They particularly like collecting dragon or Dragonborn skins for their scales. Teeth, claws, and bones get attached in various places to increase their attire to instill fear in targets. Their greatest warriors get treated as holy martyrs, having their bodies get split amongst the survivors to wear as trophies of protection. Their rank insignias are bones on the back of their gauntlets.

14. Theo's Men: a fairly large but somewhat normal group, outfitted for military engagements (several hundred troops), mostly infantry and bow. Their commander is foolhardy, but their elderly advisor is secretly a legendary commander from the last generation, trying to quietly live his life out in the background (but still making moves, he can't help it). 

15. Band of the Hawk: A band of infantry and cavalry that has never known defeat in their few short years. Their commander is a brilliant, beautiful white haired youth. Their 2nd in command is a hulking brute, swinging a sword bigger than any man, and rumored to have defeated 100 knights in a single battle.

16. Grunt's Runts: A band of goblins (or if the setting doesn't have any, short people), who specialize as sappers, saboteurs, assassins, and guerilla warfare. Almost disorganized, their loose leadership allows individuals and cells to work autonomously. They have trained to do inhuman feats, like hiding still in a ditch for days before acting. They are NOT CHEAP, and show strong results (but not in directly conflict). 

17. Thunder of Hooves: A band of mounted bowmen (and lances) from far away, rarely dismounting from their horses. Their division is large enough to be relevant in war, but are willing to take jobs that require as few as 10. They have excellent discipline and training. They clearly value their own lives, and would never take the front line, choosing skirmishing, flanking tactics. 

18. Fallen Leaves: A small mercenary group (100 or so) that come from the forested region. They largely stay in rough terrain; mountains, forests, swamps, where their tracking and survivalist skills come in handy. Given the correct environment, these 100 troops could outmaneuver, flank, ambush, trap, and generally slap around a force of any size. Continuously giving ground before breaking through and starting over again with hit-and-run tactics

19. Alexander of Grez: A tiny band of 9 individuals, their leader negotiates for specific roles in battle and espionage. No one knows how he manages to deliver, it's like he has the devil's luck. But so far, the rumors state he has never failed even the most ridiculous tasks, far beyond the capability of those 9 individuals. 

20. 20 Skulls: A necromancer who has figured out how to raise numerous dead, and have them follow orders. After raising them, he gives them one order: follow the instructions of the person holding their flag. This is the only order given before handing the flag over to the buyer. While generally detested, the savings are enormous. The band's name is 20 skulls, as that's what 1 pound of gold gets you. The skeletons are of no particular skill or ability, besides the general benefits of being undead and completely loyal. (or are they?)

21. Furious Fire: A small band of one man and a great dragon. The man is young, barely even a man. The dragon is humongous, it's unbelievable that it follows the young man's calls. But here they are, haggling for more coin to back up your army. The young man appears to have NO idea what the value of such a dragon is to the military, and you may see them in tiny encounters, but also missing from large ones. The dragon appears to be... bored... most of the time, but keeps an eye out for his master. Generally doing the least amount needed to fulfill their contract. (The dragon has a debt to the boy's grandfather, to care for him until he retakes the throne of a faraway kingdom) 

22. Spears and Shackles: A detestable lot. From far away, what is normally a slave caravan transforms into a tiny forced conscript army as needed. Outfitted with just a sword, shield and spear (burlap jerkin, no shoes), the warriors are kept in a chain gang, and forced to fight in phalanx formation. The chain connects to a brace around each neck; when a warrior falls, often their ""comrades"" have to remove the dead weight from the chain in a very... gruesome... fashion. Some of the members are utterly green, just fodder. But a few have survived many engagements, wittling down to the few cold, murderous ones. The drivers are a disgusting lot, spending all their time haggling to get 2x or 3x the normal price, and not paying attention to the losses. 

23. Ring of Fire: A band of 12 mages who work together to cast ritual magic on the battlefield. They always negotiate for a secure location in battle, cast their spells and leave. They even have their own armed bodyguards to protect themselves from attack, or betrayal. Lords feel comfortable hiring them, knowing exactly what they value (safety) and that they have no allegiance except to their current contract. 

24. Whistling Wind: A small boy, maybe 9 years old, dragging a huge sword around (maybe 30 pounds and 7 feet long). The boy is downtrodden, but not unkempt. He warns people to not get close (he keeps a berth of nearly 20 feet from everyone). His negotiations are odd. Sometimes he can command huge prices. Other times he just needs to make a little coin, often begging for an advance to eat. He always chooses to sleep in the stables. All this is due to his curse: The sword is a magic, dancing sword that will forever protect the boy from all enemies. However, the sword has never found someone to be the boy's friend (it ignores most animals). So in all directions, this sword will fly, swing, twirl, sweep, and parry any threat, in horribly efficient fashion (faster than the eye can see).  In battle it is a gory sight; the boy simply walks or runs into the center of their formation, a spray of meat slung in all directions, continually keeping a radius of 10 feet around him clear of all enemies, arrows, siege engines, etc...

25. The Band of Ash, a large mercenary company composed primarily of goliaths. Named for their greyish skin, they specialize in siegebreaking.

26. The Bright Dawn, a small mercenary strike team that specializes in combatting undead sually by finding the source and removing it).

27. The Golden Sun’s - a group of Pyromancers who specialize in large scale destruction and repelling sieges utilizing fire magic.

28. The Pack of Fangs. The land inhabited by the six clans is rife with dangerous beasts and monsters. Annually the clans would donate their most vicious warriors, adept magic users, or even ""problem individuals"" more suited to battle than civilized life. Their duty, to seek out and destroy the beasts that threatened the nomadic clans travelling the wilderness. That was a thousand years ago. Since then the pack of fangs has evolved. Now, with the beasts and monsters in check, they have become an autonomous mercenary company. They turn their attention to the new threats to the clans: tyrants, warlords, bandits, and cultists.

29. The Northern Winds. A small company composed of aaracokras (they may feature other flying creatures). Specialized in surprise aerial attacks.

30. The Faceless. A secretive group of shapeshifters such as changelings. Specialized in infiltration, spy work, quiet assassinations.

31. Kelm's Konqueror's, a mixed unit of armored warriors and magi. The warriors work in tandem with the magi to defend the spellcasters' works. Kelm, the company's founder and leader, is an archmage with a penchant for war magic, having served in a number of fabled wars prior to establishing his own sellsword company. The company's warriors enchant the armors and weaponry of the warrior prior to entering engagement, and dominate the battlefield with commanding area of effect magics and by subjugating enemy commanders. The fee for procuring the aid of Kelm's Konqueror's is half the spoils of conquest, lest the company turn on its employers and sunder their leadership in a wave of retaliation.

32. Aystrayed Union Company, a small mercenary company made up of oathbreaker palidans from all oaths. Specializes in heavy armor and intimidation

33. Worshippers of (war god here), a meduim mercenary company of war clerics that worship(war god here). In various settings there are various war gods, so basically everything is interchangeable

34. Academics and Company, a large mercenary company of expelled students from magic academies and primarily made up of young graduates who cannot find jobs. Specializes in destruction magic

35. Veteran's Band, a large mercenary company made up of war veterans with undiagnosed PTSD and no ither purpose besides war. Specializes in battle tactics that can turn impossible odds into favorable

36. Blood Raiders, a medium mercenary band of former bandits and criminals. Specializes in quick killing with serrated cleavers - a close range weapon that bleeds the opponent to death

37. Black Dog, a small mercenary company made up of nomads and old animal handlers. Specializes in using various dogs and dog-likes to fight

38. Dust Bandits, a meduim mercenary company of bandits that provide ""protection"". Specializes in arid environments with their ""dust goggles"" that allow them to kick up dirt and fight through sandstorms with ease

39. The Reavers, a large mercenary company made up of once slaves that now fight for the company. Specializes in raiding enemy towns and cities for slaves to add to their army to weaken the enemy from their home turf

40. Ethereal Cult Company, a meduim mercenary company that are convinced they are gods and cannot be hurt by normal means. Specializes in non lethal weaponary(sometimes) and persuasion

41. Crab Raiders, a meduim mercenary company composed of crab ranchers who really love their big crabs, like a lot. Specializes in magic resistant armour and crab

42. The soldado company experts in siege warfare they had been hired by a local king to take a rival kingdoms capital city. Upon doing so they were snubbed on their payment so took the city for themselves and now wage war on the king who refused their payment. Like most mercenary companies they are composed of a multitude of nationalities but speak common so that they can communicate orders on the battlefield. Their general is Roger de Flores who was the second son of a noble man and as a young man became part of a religious military order. He used his earnings from this to start a life in piracy and used this money to form the company.

43. The Wildcards - Band of exccentric yet professional people that will get the job done, no matter what it is . The thing is they use unorthodox methods in order to achieve it.

44. Calling card/Banner - a set of cards in Full house order


45. The Deadman's Hand - if you wanna sent a MESSAGE, these are your people. Most Ruthless motherfuckers from all parts of the world. 
They once forced a siege to break up by using dead bodies of sick people as projectiles. 

46. Led by Viron Masropo - Man who should have died from a killing blow to the head, but by sheer force of will (and Magic assist) he managed to escape death. He has a big scar across his face as a result.

47. Clement's Cuirassiers, a heavy cavalry regiment armed with adamantine lances. when they tilt at windmills- or a fortification's walls- full-send, expecting the target to fall, they're not often wrong. This versatility as both cavalry and pseudo-artillery commands a high price, but Clement's honor can't be bought; he won't knowingly fight for wicked men. 

48. Sky Reiters; light cavalry mounted on flying steeds; one or an assortment of Hippogriffs, Griffons, Wyverns, or others. They are based out of a tower captured from an evil wizard too 'wizardly' to use stairs, making it a stronghold accessible only to them (or, in theory, another mage who can fly). They usually operate by attacking from range for a time until their targets are sufficiently disorganized, then crushing their enemies from under a few tons of armored talons, hooves, claws and sharpened steel, before snatching up survivors and dropping them from 50+ feet.

49. Jor's Jackals - a mercenary group with unscrupulous morals and unsavory tactics. Specializes in urban infiltration and combat, but have also proven themselves skilled in scouting and recon across multiple terrains. Their leader, Jor, is clever but cruel, and those who serve under her learn quickly not to cross her, but rather tend to take their frustrations out on those around them. Not many wish to join such a group, so Jor tends to recruit from former convicts, drunks, and low-lifes.

50. The Iron Shield - made up of mostly former military, this large mercenary company has impeccable discipline, well-rounded skills, and a solid reputation. Often hired by local rulers to supplement their actual armies, the Iron Shield has until recently been serving a standing contract with [X country]. Rumor has it the contract was severed abruptly when the Steel Post's leader was accused of murdering a member of [X country's] high council, but no one knows for sure.

51. Kurak's Whip - Fast-moving and deadly, this small mercenary group relies on winged mounts and a small number of skilled mages to respond to threats swiftly and ruthlessly. While in the past they have worked for whomever paid the most coin, their current leader, a fierce Aarakora named Kurak, has a noble streak, and will no longer accept contracts they consider immoral or cruel. Not all of Kurak's soldiers are on board with this change, however, and whispers of possible mutiny are starting to rumble.

52. The Demon Moths - specialization in night time prisoner liberation.

53. **The Penal Legion:** An informal title used to describe the motley assortment of brigands, cutthroats, criminals, and outlaws the kingdom has pressed into service, with the deal being that they will serve the kingdom in exchange for a shortened sentence. Members are almost always sent on extremely dangerous black ops missions, leading to a high mortality rate. All field agents are forced to wear magical collars that can be remotely detonated in the event of insubordination.

54. **The Blades:** A highly secretive organization specializing in espionage and assassination. Their prices are steep, but they always get the job done. Secretly, the Blades are a front for a cult that worships the god of murder.

55. **The Knee-Breakers:** Comprised entirely of goblins, kobolds, and other small peoples, the Knee-Breakers use their diminutive size to great effect in missions of sabotage and infiltration. So-named for their tendency to aim for their opponents knees in battle.

56. **The HellKnights:** The epitome of ruthless efficiency. Mounted warriors clad in spiked, jet-black armor, the specialize in hunting down criminals and quelling uprisings. Devoutees of Asmodeus, their ranks include many infernal warlocks and evil clerics.

57. **The Deathless Watch:** A particularly gruesome company comprised entirely of undead. Their specialty is auctioning off their undead for use in crypts and dungeons. Their leader is an enigmatic necromancer known only as the Pale Master.

58. The Black Roses: A band of mercs who specialize in alchemy and nature magic

59. Fleet of the Yellow Flag- A band of sailors specializing in coastal waters and rivers. Their ability to move men and material is known far and wide, as is their fondness of night raids. All their ships fly a featureless yellow flag.

60. The Scarlet Rain- A fleet of small, fast river ships and their equally fast crews. Armed with long poles and good sword arms, their ability to perform boarding actions is second-to-none as is their love of blood red tattoos.

61. Knights of the Shadows- A small squadron of knights, who specialize in silent attacks but with the strength of a guard unit. Well versed in blades and land vehicles.

62. The platinum pen: a mercenary Corp like ""The Black Company"" books that run with nightmares as cavalry, they would also have access to ""metallic tiefling"", that have the ability to translate the exact amount something is worth. But only in the currency that said tiefling is relevant to: from copper, to Platinum, or other. They can also be paid to fish you and your party out of the astral plane. Continuing on that they tend to do assassinations that consist of: Fighter cavalier with nightmare, rouge assassin, and one other class. Combined with their nightmares give off a blue fire light instead of the natural red.

63. Bokha's rouge host- a very strange, communal, self-governing, semi-nomadic and paramilitary group hailing from the farthest wild frontiers of a far away empire. They're a notably versatile group; at ease skirmishing on foot, on horseback, or by boat; scaling walls, raiding supply lines, or destroying the lairs of monstrous humanoids. In a straight up fight or siege, they're a bit of a crapshoot, often hinging on the morale of of fickle free spirits. Bokha fights for money alongside titles and diplomatic recognition. 

64. Last adventurists- These troops somehow found an ancient armory stockpile of magical weapons and shields from a long-collapsed empire of apparently great arcane erudition, so much so they could enchant ordinance weapons. They revere bravery in the face of danger much more than tactical genius, limiting themselves as a sort of sledgehammer for destroying supernatural threats. 

65. Field of Honor's Old Guard- Instead of military formation, these duelists excel in single combat. While Judicial duels, duels of honor, or champion warfare are often overlooked, banned or unheard of in certain locales, the Old Guard is one of the few organizations who fills the niche. Membership is an exclusive, bordering secretive affair, and people who falsely claim membership often don't live long. People who claim the pseudo secret society does assassination work don't live long either.

66. The Golden Role, a large band of displaced refugees who fight notorious mercenaries at a significant discount. They specialize in polearms, no specific kind.

67. Following of the Once Moon, a meduim unified warrior religion who believe the rings around the planet was once a thing called a ""Moon"". They specialize in a weapon found nowhere else in the world, a moon cleaver, so poeple dont know how to counter it

68. Arc's Company, a small mercenary company that served in (war) a time ago, but the war was so destructive on the troops most lost limbs. They specialize in arcane limbs and pity of the enemy to gain a leg up(pun intended)

69. Feigned Resentment, a meduim mercenary company made up of drifters and vagrants. They specialize in sabres and close-combat

70. Troglodyte Warrior Union, a small mercenary company made up if troglodytes. They specialize in ruthless combat and being leterial monsters

71. **The Toadstool Eight's Legion:** A group of gnolls, dressed in a ramshackle of different armors, weapons, and other gimmicks. The members are a bit strange, with the higher-ranked gnolls specializing in strange or odd arts. They specialize in creating chaos on the battlefield. They are lead by a fungal-infested druid-matriarch. 

72. **The Red Hoard:** A hoard of gnolls who specialize as shock troops. They are lead by an muscle-bound matriarch with a diplomatic streak.   


73. **The Master's Demand:** A selection of magical beasts and cursed adventures who work for a mysterious lich. They are lead by an insane, gnollish warlock who follows his mad master's bidding. 

  
74. **Daisy-Chains:** A small circus ran by a kindly old woman. It is of course, a hag's circus. It focuses on corrupting the citizens of enemy country, encouraging treason and riots, or looting and pillaging non-combatants, such as  farms, religious centers and economic centers.

75. The Poison-Oaks - A small band of alchemists that specialize in disrupting the enemy's terrain or ecosystem. Jobs they've done include poisoning enemy water supplies, spreading diseases among farm animals and crops, causing controlled forest fires where the enemy is camped, slowing enemy advances by making terrain muddy, triggering lighting strikes on target buildings, and even once freezing a whole lake where enemy ships were sailing.

76. The Chaotic Order - A monk order, ironically who believe chaos is the natural order of things, allow themselves to be hired out for covert ops in enemy lands. They dress as causal citizens but use their unique fighting style suited for urban combat tilizing common objects as improvised weapons to disguise as street brawls) to engineer unrest in the town they're assigned to. They have been used to incite riots, rebellions, and have even triggered civil wars.

78. The Followers of the Stars - Few people know of this cult's existence, and even fewer dare to sign a contract with them. These cultists, always wearing hooded blue robes and wearing black blindfolds with a golden eye stitched onto it, merely ask for a hundred disposable humanoids as the price for their services, though for what purpose one can only speculate. Once received discreetly, the Followers call upon the eldritch entity they worship, singing in a horrible ancient tongue. Exactly what the entity does for the client is unclear, but some examples include an entire battalion going into a permanent coma, a costal town that somehow collapsed into the sea, and a meteor that obliterated a king's palace. 

79. The Earthshakers - A small group of monster tamers and experienced miners who specialize in borrowing underground to get behind enemy lines. They utilize monsters like bulettes and purple worms to dig tunnels to allow troops to infiltrate or use for surprise attacks.

80. The Cloud Skippers - A few cloud giants, in one of their whimsical ideas, decided it would be fun to descend to the various humanoids in conflict with each other and fight for the side that seems the most fun. Innately gifted with both combat prowess and illusion magics, they are a huge asset in both battle and scouting. Though one of their quirks is that they prefer to fight on the side they perceive to be losing, to ""give themselves a challenge"". They are clever enough to have avoided any casualties so far but should one of them be slain, the fun and games stop there.

81. We Many Mice: A band of... mice!? They are able to speak and use tools (somehow). There are many thousands of them, and they use the coin they earn to set up sanctuaries in the major cities. Some of them can speak, and understand enough to accomplish simple missions. Usually that of eavesdropping, theft, and assassinations by poison. To this point they are mostly a rumor, hired primarily by the King and his court, who try to keep them a secret."
29,"1. Vs low-int opponent, ""I don't know whether to use *charm person* or *speak with animals*.""
2. Vs aberration, ""Did you really think that I would find slime and tentacles attractive?""
3. Vs werewolf/gnoll/any other beastman, ""Oh great, a furry.""
4. Vs undead, ""Oh please, you've died once before. Do you really think that you can't die again?""
5. Vs anyone, ""Do you really think that I'm going to waste my best material on you?"""
30,"Trying to make a (fun) list of court cases that the King has to hear during a day at court. To start off:

Who should get the chicken?

36. The owner of a local bridge outside town has come to plead for lower tax rates so they can afford to hire a better class of troll.

The troll has come to plead a related case and wants the owner to buy more than ""one scrawny ewe each fortnight"", although the contract that is produced says ""at least 2 sheep each month"". The troll will grow larger if properly fed.

31,"I like creating settings and I think the DMGs advice regarding having some core assumptions of your world you can constantly tether back to is pretty helpful but I get stumped on creating unique ideas. I'll start with a few from the DMG and add a few of my own to get this going.

&#x200B;

1. ***Much of the World is Untamed:*** Wild regions abound. City-states, confederacies, and kingdoms of various sizes dot the landscape, but beyond their borders the wilds crowd in. People know the area they live in well. They've heard stories of other places from merchants and travelers, but few know what lies beyond the mountains or in the depths of the great forest unless they've been there themselves.
2. ***The World is Ancient:*** Empires rise and fall, leaving few places that have not been touched by imperial grandeur or decay. War, time, and natural forces eventually claim the mortal world, leaving it rich with places of adventure and mystery. Ancient civilizations and their knowledge survive in legends, magic items, and their ruins. Chaos and evil often follow an empire's collapse.
3. ***The Gods have Died or Left:*** The Gods have all died or left following The Primordial War. In battle with the ancient primordial lords, the gods fought back and placated the embodiment of the primary 4 elements. In doing so, they've given this world a more rigid state and locked away the primordial lords into the 4 primary elemental planes. Many of the gods were killed in this fight, and it seems since, the others have left. Pieces of the deceased gods can be found across the world and many civilizations are rushing to take claim of what they can.
4. ***Magic is at Odds with Technology:*** While magic is enchanting and powerful in it's own right, it can also be dangerous and unwieldy. Technology is beginning to make great strides, although it originally aimed to mimic the magical powers of those who could wield it. Due to it's frequent reliability and availability, the common people are rallying behind technological innovations. Those who have spent the time or have the natural capability find themselves shunned at best and vilified at worst.
5. ***The World is the Center of a Cosmic Clash:*** Surrounded by planes of existence that are malleable by their inhabitants, the Material Plane is largely shaped and static. Out of curiosity or for some unknown resource, this world is frequently scouted, and invaded by creatures from other planes of existence. While we're unsure what they're after, the mortal races band together for reluctant peace to combat these frequent intruders."
32,"PROGRESS: 100/100

I was brainstorming some interesting minor locations to put into my current hex crawl campaign, locations that aren’t combat oriented but instead prompts creative problem solving.

34,"I need this for my upcoming sessions and I'd appreciate any help.
So basically put anything scary about monsters, magic, eldritch horrors or just strange people. Body horror etc. It is also appreciated bc that's the tone of the current questline.

1. While travelling along the road the party meets a preacher of a god that was thought to be dead and he tells them that they don't have much time left before he rises once more.

2. Animals around start to get more and more distorted as if they weren't really there. The cause is a nearby pet cemetery.

3. Around the area the party starts to find several bloody organs that seem to have been ripped from a humanoid somewhere nearby.

4. Nearby a single petrified person can be found that looks like a weirdly realistic statue.

5. A small temple ruin with a few cultists inside. They are friendly to the party and will offer food with a sleeping potion inside. If the party falls asleep they will try to sacrifice them.

-viscumin:
6. The party finds an altar to an ancient forgotten god. There is a small offering on the altar. If the party disturbs the altar or offering they get a minor curse from the god. If they leave an offering they receive a minor boon.

-thomas_powell:
7. The party is walking along a road towards a lone tree in the distance. As they get closer, they realize that the tree is made up of blood and torn bodies and pieces of bodies which have been strung together. Some of the victims are still alive, and bite/whisper to any players who investigate.

8. After they make camp for the night, the party is attacked while they are sleeping and vulnerable (or they hear soft crying coming from all directions in the woods).

9. When the party wakes up in the morning, they find their camp has been rummaged through and some of their items are missing. Strange totems have been strategically placed around their bedrolls. They are unable to tell what the totems signify or are for.

10. The next time a player takes a drink from their canteen, they find that the water has all turned into a thick black sludge, which tastes awful (CON saving throw if they swallow it). If they investigate the canteen, they find a hairy bug or writhing slug which has nested on the inside of it. Upon seeing the creature, the player becomes concerned that the sludge may have contained the creature's eggs.

11. The party meets a group of travellers on the road, or in a town. In the 
travelling group is someone who claims to have the same name/backstory/everything as one of the players. They seem genuine and convinced that they are the ""real"" ones.

-earth_salt:
12. As you set up camp for the night you see lights bobbing slowly up and down at the edge of the forest, weaving in and out of sight. The first watch hears a blood-curdling scream. (I used this as trapped souls of the dead flickering trying to bring others to find their bodies, but what kills one person tends to be deadly to others as well.)

13. There is a small island in the centre of a large lake. In the centre of the island is a monk wearing weather-worn clothing meditating on a small square of cloth. The monk refuses to speak, opens their eyes, and is (somehow) entirely resistant to damage or movement. (There is an evil spirit trapped in the lake, and they have been placed under a spell akin to an upcast Gentle Repose to allow them to keep the thing locked away forever.)

14. In the middle of a dense but very peaceful forest the party finds the aftermath of a successful cult summoning. Dead bodies riddle a wooden altar covered with holly and spruce. While investigating the party comes in contact with the spirit of the forest (who is helpful and kind) that readily admits it was summoned by the cult, but says it was likely a mistake as they are a benevolent forest spirit that wants to spread the forest in a way that benefits both the animals that live within and those towns that live at its borders. The cult, however, continues to make sacrifices of blood and flesh to expand the forest (thinking the spirit will give them powers/gifts), which the spirit happily accepts. (The spirit keeps wild animals from attacking and allows quick growth of trees and beneficial plants, often growing specifically what neighbouring towns need, but if the cult is stopped the forest will wither and become a twisted and dangerous place without the caring hand of the spirit.)

15. While travelling in the forest, the party encounters a rabid beast that looks like someone stuck a boar's head on a wolf's body with deer legs. Inspecting the animal shows it was magically combined. More odd animal combinations appear, some living normally, others obviously in pain, and eventually the party starts coming across obvious human hybrids. (A druid is trying desperately to create a new life in an attempt to bring civilization closer to nature, trying to draw the benefits of nature to humanoids - an easy way to introduce Simic hybrids.)

-tturtle-man:
16. A small humanoid is seen walking towards the party on the same road as them, however, due to the slightly hilly nature of the road, they lose sight of the person briefly. During that time the person disappears, with no evidence as to where they came from or went.

-bafflinghalfling:
17. A bloody puddle with a child's doll. The doll is sobbing. (Can turn into a monster of your choice upon being picked up)

18. A tombstone in the middle of the trail they are on. The same stone shows up several different times. On the 5th time, the name changes to a member of the party, and the ground rumbles and opens up beneath that member of the party.

-ericmoulds:
19. Travelling bookseller; can be a plot/lore delivery device, random info giver, or even one of those Lvl up books in stock.

-contributionusual106:
20. A person screams in the distance/nearby.

-sundaecide:
21. A hole in the ground surrounded by deer, foxes and other forest animals kneeling in apparent prayer, they are not sentient but appear to be wearing crude crowns and other adornments. The hole spews a white smoke that causes hallucinations.

22. Marionettes strung with red thread that exactly resemble the party are found hanging from a stand in an extremely well-hidden room. Once investigated, the room vanished completely without a trace.

23. A dog with an uncannily emotive face begins to follow the party at a distance. Once spotted, it now appears everywhere somewhere in the distance just staring. If killed the dog returns the next day. If approached, it speaks the words ""He sees you"" and nothing else."

37,"The last one of these I posted was so much fun and everyone had so many good ideas! So now I wanted to share some of my ideas that I've come up with for my Strixhaven campaign, and brainstorm some other fun classes for magical student PCs to partake in. Worth noting, is that my version of Strixhaven heavily focuses on the classes being actual adventures ""themed"" to have academic value somehow related to them. Also, the colleges often send students on each others field trips as there is often research to be done for all or some of the colleges depending on the trip. I'm also open to ideas on how to make the classes I've come up with more interesting! :) 

1. A Matter of Perspective: An Introductory Course on the Benefits, and Uses of the Enlarge/Reduce Spell - I imagine this one as a dungeon with lots of gaps and small passages and pathways that require you to change sizes to get through, as well as monsters that would benefit from being reduced or enlarged to make them easier to fight. I plan to give the party enlarge/reduce harnesses and/or wands of enlarge/reduce. Inspiration ideas for this one: Ant-Man, Ratchet and Clank: Size Matters, Portal 2, Zelda: Minish Cap

2. A Matter of Perspective v2: Playing God - Students are given a tiny handheld village of living people who are at odds with each other and must use their omniscient perspective to help them out. Inspiration: Godfellas from Futurama, Gulliver's Travels, Civilization, that classic taking care of an egg like it's a baby trope.

3. A Matter of Perspective v3 Going Inside A Guy For Some Reason - Just like the classic adventure of shrinking and going inside a guy. Inspiration: Osmosis Jones, The Magic School Bus, Rick and Morty Anatomy Park 

3. Exploring Creativity with Nolzur’s Marvelous Pigments v1 - for this one, students are dropped on a deserted island with only the clothes on their back and must survive for a week using only the pigments. Inspiration: Eventide Island from Breath of the Wild, Minecraft, most survival games

4. Exploring Creativity with Nolzur’s Marvelous Pigments v2 - Must use only the pigments to navigate a dungeon and recover the relic inside. Inspo: Epic Mickey, Green Lantern, Graffiti Kingdom, Kirby Canvas Curse, ChalkZone

5. Exploring Creativity with Nolzur’s Marvelous Pigments v3 A Village In Need -  All these villagers have all these problems, and all you have is... some magical paint that can fix literally everything. Inspo: Scribblenauts

6. Exploring Creativity v4 The Mad Libs Dungeon - for this one students get to decide the items/monsters/traps of a dungeon as they run through it. For example ""after dodging the [adjective] [plural noun] pit, you're suddenly attacked by a giant [monster]!"" Inspo: Mad Libs, Ghostbusters

6. Art History, Exploring the World Within the Painting - Students are sucked into the world of a painting ala Dark Souls or Super Mario 64 

7. Alchemy/Anatomy: Grung Poison and It's Effects - Students must travel to the jungle and capture a few different colors of grung so they can be dissected and studied for their poisonous effects. maybe a 2-parter where part one is collecting and dissecting grung, and part two is crafting and testing a poison or potion using their guts.

8. Language Arts: Developing Healing Words and Vicious Mockeries - Students will develop their own magical words of power through a class focused on compliment battles and slam poetry. 

9. Language Arts: Dealing with Fey - a professor studying the Feywild has been kidnapped by harengons and sold to the eladrin king of spring, you must use your words carefully to navigate arranging his return. This one pretty I much stole from a [dndbeyond article]( and have been working on to use myself later, [here's]( a google doc with my ideas for it (please forgive my lack of structure lol)

9. Intro to Dungeon Delving - students will explore the most dungeon-y dungeon ever, with spike pits, poison darts, and all the works, of course they're all just simulated (...unless it's been sabotaged) but through this class students will learn the value of a ten foot pole, rope, a crowbar, and even a bag of flour. 

10. Advanced Biology: Novel Dragon Species Egg Acquisition - the dracobiology team have found the lair of a yet undiscovered species of dragon, naturally we need some students to sneak in to it's lair and steal some eggs while the field team distracts the mother. as long as they stay quiet, the mother *shouldn't* notice them...

11. Advanced Biology 2: Hatching and Raising a Dragon Egg! - just what every ~~party~~ biology student dreams of, raising their very own baby dragon. Definitely no way that could go wrong :)

12. Anthropology: Fringe Dwarven Subcultures - A mysterious race of dwarves lives deep within the forgotten mountain city of Cloudhook. They never make their way to the surface because they fear the sun will turn them to stone. However what they don't know is that a basilisk lives near the surface and turns any dwarves the leave to stone. Killing the monster is one part of the problem, convincing the dwarves that it's not the sun is another."

Edit: Updated with ideas from comments. Thanks everyone! We're getting close."
40,"Because apparently there aren't enough dragons in your life. 

1. The Dungeon and Dragon. A famous bar ran by Fred, the ancient Red.

2. The Bardic Arcanavision program Hoarders. You know the rest...

3. As a result of the recession, young dragons are now gainfully employed as forge techs in Smithy's.

4. Mr Draco De Verde. This curious older gentleman has a slight green sheen to his skin and runs a famous library. No one knows how long he's been alive, he's available for hire as a history tutor and tells tales of ancient times as if he was there 😉 he prefers payment in knowledge.

5. Captain Baha of the Doupeq. A famous sky galley Captain on a mission to hunt down Big Richard, a dragon that has been terrorising the North Winds for many a year.

6. The third Countess just attended the last royal ball with a new psuedodragon familiar. This was supposed to be the debut of the younger Marquess, but they were totally upstaged. The senior Marquess has tasked you with finding a faerie dragon to outshine the Countess at her next ball.

7. The airship flight paths have been disrupted by a dragon relocating to a nearby mountain.

8. The mystic university's library has been infiltrated by a ""paper dragon"". Find the bookwyrm and eliminate it before it eats another apprentice.

9. Arctic adventurers have found a new thermal oasis cutting a weeks travel through the northern mountains. Little do they know that the cave's warmth comes from a stranded dragon.

10. The teleportation mechanics have to be carefully balanced around know points of power, and can be occasionally 'redirected' by unplanned mystical focus points. A dragon's horde has started interfering with teleportation rituals.

11. Blackened Books. The sickening Wyrm ""Moran"" and his hobbling assistant, the abominable Bailey operate this run down establishment on the edge of the mages quarters. 

12. A sinister band of dwarves have taken a village as slaves, spending day and night working in a factory... To build a mechanical dragon!

13. An over-excited wizard is trying to resurect an ancient legendary dragon... Because he thinks dragons are cool and has not given thought about any issues that might arise from it.

14. A king tasks you to rescue a princess from a tower guarded by a dragon. Along the way, a roughset man tells you that his daughter is also being held at the same tower. Then a pigherd interjects that his sister is there too. And so on. It turns out that the dragon is a regular lothario and the tower is his booty call base for his harem.

15. a fat, lazy dragon makes it's home in the town bakery ever since the Baker won it over by getting addicted to their baked goods. The dragon makes its rent by tending the oven and handling the financials. In return, its tided over with free baked goods.

16. (14a) You enter a town with a suspiciously high number of sorcerers and various forms of half-dragon. 

17. The players encounter an ancient red dragon. The dragon is distraught, and doesn't so much want to eat the players as pick their minds for advice on how to get his recently ex girlfriend to take him back. His recently ex girlfriend is Tiamat, he was one of her consorts, and they had a falling out.
/LucidFir thinks the dragon should be black and have a number of trapped emo/goth bardic groups playing at his behest)

18. Due to complex political circumstances, the mayor of the town you’re in is technically the young dragon whose nest the miners recently unearthed. The man in the town hall just translates for them.

19. A green dragon doesn't so much land as crash near your party while you're resting for the night. Luckily for you, this is a well known dragon who most people call Puff (they might have a different name, but very few if any people know it... and that possibly includes the dragon themselves) who, through a weird quirk of biology, has a breath that acts more like a relaxing vapor then anything else. They're constantly ""high on their own supply"", so to speak, and hence very chilled, open to talk about a lot of things, and likes to land (as best as they can) near the shiny light of campfires and just watch the fire go. Unfortunately, this nature is well known enough for a few more unscrupulous individuals to get the idea of claiming the dragon's breath for themselves, one way or another...

20. The First Kobold Bank's vault is really a dragon's hoard. The kobolds convinced the dragon that the easiest way to grow it's hoard is through charging interest on loans. When someone defaults a loan they get eaten.

21. There is a wildlife preserve outside the city that is considered protected grounds, an ancient dragon uses the grounds to maintain a large herd of deer/elk/cattle etc. Someone is poaching from the forest, and you need to stop the poacher before the dragon who ""owns"" those grounds finds out and starts eating people.

22. The town has historically paid tribute to the dragon to prevent it from burning the city to the ground. The dragon has started torching the outskirts as a warning. It turns out someone in the mayor's office has been skimming from the tribute. Find out who before the dragon gets really angry.

23. A dragon in disguise hires the party to pentest (penetration test) his horde. He wants to know if there is any way for someone to sneak into his lair. Then he can patch the holes that the party discovers. After eating the party.

24. The party is at sea on a boat. There is a storm and they wash up on an island. They don't know that the island is the back of a giant dragon turtle.

25. That person you seduced? Guess what champ.

26. That hill you just stepped on? You are walking on the Ancient Green Dragon Ballistar's back... and she is grumpy at being tickled awake...

27. Tiny dragons are employed like pigs hunting for truffles, hunting out tiny relics of gold for archaeologists.

28. These tiny dragons can also go wild and take up residence in someone's home, stealing all the loose change and jewelry they find and hoarding it under the floorboards.

29. The dragon is on a grand vacation (an event potentially spanning decades and planes), and has decided that the party are a great source of entertainment. Wherever the party goes, the dragon shows up with beverage and short-range scrying crystal in hand to watch the show and message commentary at the party from a sunny hillside or cozy hot spring. Direct interaction is rare but can be helpful or a nuisance depending on boredom levels and cocktail count as much as personality.

30. The dragon is interested in growing their hoard through entrepreneurship- they'll happily broker magical items or offer loans of gold, but their dealings tend to be, well, fair but draconian.

31. [Black dragon, who uses his [acid] breath to curdle milk in his successful cheese empire. The cheese has magical properties, and it costs a lot of gold, which of course the dragon hordes.](

32. After a spate of visitors spending fey coins in the market, the city now employs a dragon to police the coinage. He sniffs out any false gold, and has been granted free reign in disposing of the perpetrators.


33. The adventurers finish a dungeon, and as they recover at a tavern, a letter is delivered anonymously, “Worthy adventurers! I hear you have completed the first part of my game. If you do not wish to feel missold on the titlular concept, please make your way to mount redwing at your convenience”. /tonyangtigre suggests that it should be 2+ dungeons and 2+ dragons in order to be in theme)

34. Pest Control Duty. Adventurers are furious because the guild isn't paying out for bounties. Apparently, there's an unwelcome squatter in the guild vault that makes withdrawing gold problematic...

35. Lady Sybil's Dragon Sanctuary

36. The knight that was hired to rescue the princess from the dragon? The dragon is actually the knight AND the princess and is simply incredibly bored."
41,"Hi, guys, I need your help: I'm gonna DM a murder mystery one-shot in a few weeks and the PCs are starting at level 5. One of the players chose the Zone of Truth spell and if he uses it correctly, the adventure may come to an end really soon. There's one bad guy and everyone else is good, so if the bad guy resists the spell, it's obvious that he's the villain because the others accepted it and told the truth. And if the bad guy is affected, he will reveal his crime.

So, why would the - guilty or innoccent - NPCs deny or resist being subject to the Zone of Truth spell? Most importantly: how would they justify their resistance?

&#x200B;

1. Someone on their family died because of magic, so they're afraid of it.
2. They don't trust the PCs and think they're trying to lure them into a magic trap.
3. They have secrets, like everyone, and don't want them to come up.
4. They're extremely offended for being treated as suspects.
5. They have to be somewhere else asap.

42,"Your background as a Divination wizard, your deity/patron, or certain magic items let you dive into the knowledge of things yet to come. Divination magic has a huge potential when employed correctly, but often this is easier said than done. Foretelling events is tricky, and sometimes it can lead to misunderstandings or to irrelevant information. Today, I want to work in the latter.

I'm interested in things not relevant to the plot, but actually anecdotal, curious, interesting or outright funny to see.

Let's go!

#D100 glimpsed future events
-

1. Somewhere in the middle of the forest, another party has set camp. What it seems to be the ranger of the group tries to harpoon a fish from a nearby river, but they slip on a mossy rock and fall into the water, soaking themselves. The rest of the party finds this hilarious.
----

2. For around 7 seconds you have misty visions of a kinda hot person taking a relaxing bath in a bathtub. There's a 50% chance you actually know that person.

3. You see an old person leaning back in a fancy chair, focused in the lecture of an ancient scroll in what seems to be a personal library or study room of sorts. After a few seconds, they turn the head and stare right at you as the vision vanishes.

4. Somewhere in the forest you see someone playing dead as a an adult owlbear uses them as a pillow. It's... not a comfortable situation, not for this individual at least.

5. A musty smell invades your nose as a dank scenario draws before you. These are the sewers of some settlement. There you see someone giving what you believe to be a full speech to a dozen crocodiles. They are paying attention and even seem to understand what they say.

6. There's a person that walks agitatedly from one side to the other in the middle of a lonely street. As they turn, you see they are fancily dressed, and they hold a bouquet of flowers and a letter. The last thing you see is this person heading to a particular house, and the last thing you hear is the echoed knocking on the door.

7. You see two master swordsmen duelling in the ancient ruins of a castle on the edge of a cliff. /AlephBaker]

8. The view from the helm of a ship at sea appears in your mind. It's nothing special, but then you can hear the crew. They're singing a shanty in an unfamiliar language as they work. /AlephBaker]

9. The ringing of hammers on anvils, the wheezing of bellows, the occasional hissing of hot metal being quenched... you are definitely in a busy dwarven forge. Unfortunately, the view is fixed on a wall of hand axes for the duration of the vision. /AlephBaker]

10. Gulls circle and call overhead. A child's hand appears, pointing up to the clouds, and a voice says ""that one looks like a bunny!"" The cloud indicated definitely doesn't look like that. /AlephBaker]

11. Inside a cottage, an ancient wizard seems to be haggling with a man and a half-giant while standing over a corpse dressed in black. As they talk, a witch bursts in from another room and begins to berate the wizard. /AlephBaker]

12. A man sits alone at a workbench, carefully tapping at something hidden by his body. He stops for a moment, then a resounding fart is heard. He then resumes his work. /DangerMacAwesome]

14. A man and woman tuck a child into bed, kiss her good night, and blow out a candle. /DangerMacAwesome]

15. A man stands alone in a dark tunnel, his flickering lantern the only source of light. He shakes uncontrollably, turning this way and that. Slowly, an enormous spider comes into the light of the lantern. He spins and sees it, then visibly relaxes and says 'oh, glad to see you'. /DangerMacAwesome]

16. A half-orc sits at a table, writing on parchment. He finishes, then references a book. He leaps to his feet and shouts in anger, drawing an axe and swinging it at the book. He stops himself before the blow lands, takes a few deep breaths, rights his chair and begins writing again. /DangerMacAwesome]

18. You watch a clean shaven middle age man walk into a room, stand there for a moment with a confused expression on his face. 'What was I doing again…?' As he walks back out, he turns briefly almost remembering before forgetting again and continuing out. /AmoebaKlutzy]

19. Clawed hands meticulously dissect a rat on a table, taking out its internal organs and stitching it back together again. You then watch the rat eyes become completely black. The rat turns over, eats the organs left on the table, squeaks, and lastly runs away. /AmoebaKlutzy]

20. You see a shirtless dwarf bard sitting on a barstool, casually tuning his lute in preparation for the evening tavern performance. /AmoebaKlutzy]

21. Overhead, storm clouds gather. You see a coinpurse that has fallen from a pocket in the middle of a busy avenue, then you hear the sound of coin spilling. Passersby run to pick up the pennies. /ATtheorytime]

22. A server stylishly pours a queen a cup of wine. The server then spills some on the queen's dress, and is thoroughly yelled at. /ATtheorytime]

25. You see a street vendor handing over delicious meat kebab, perfectly cooked and shining with a delectable sauce you can just wish to taste some day. /someone_back_1n_time]

26. You see a group of succubi playing a game of reverse strip poker in hell. One of them is dressed up in winter gear and another has so many sweaters on she's having difficulty moving. /someone_back_1n_time]

27. You hear a robbed figure talking to itself: 'Now, heroes, you witness my victory! You've failed to stop the ritual and the time of ascension is nigh!...no.

28. You see a luxurious court, worth of royalty. There's a figure, the king, sitting in the center. As he listens to petitioners, he lets out a small fart. Everyone pretends not to notice. /funkyb]

29. Some friends play a ball game. Nothing special happens, but you can see one of them about to get hit in the face with the ball. The vision fades away fractions of a second before it happens. /funkyb]

30. A cook giving the final touch to a dish in a tavern/inn/restaurant. Unbeknownst to you, that's your dinner for tonight. /algorithmancy]

31. You perceive anger, frustration and melancholy. Then you see someone in front of a brothel, lecturing another person, probably their SO, in front of everyone. /yoggenfogger]

32. A spindly man is performing magic tricks to children in a courtyard. One of the children has just figured out the secret to a trick. /yoggenfogger]

33. Two children are digging a hole in the ground and talking about how they can't wait to put 'the thing' inside of it. There's a 50% chance that the location is familiar to you. /yoggenfogger]

36. A tavern keeper gets an order for a cheese platter, he nervously walks towards the cabinet away from view, and with a sharp knife removes the moldy parts of the cheese. The customers briefly enjoy it, but who knows what awaits them once it's digested. /Goblinofthesoup]

37. Your vision appears high over the blasted, sulphurous planes of a hellish dimension. As your vision drifts down you can make out the wailings and murmurs of the many tortured souls around you. Finally your vision settles on a figure, hunched over, dressed in rags and a tool belt, scraping gun off the bottom of a cafeteria table. You awake. /Ozzyk99]

38. You see a beautiful woman dancing along an almost blindingly white dusty plain. As she bounds and twirls, the dust drifts around her. She slows and sits to rest, humming a delicate tune and looking into the black and starry sky. Her gaze falls upon a ball of blue and white and green. She sighs and your vision fades. /SageofTheBlanketdPig]

39. You contemplate the point of view of a scribe meticulously tearing sheet after sheet of paper from a leather-bound tome. Try as you might, you lack the ability to focus on the words on these pages. Though this vision seems to last hours, in reality only a few moments seem to have passed. Like a dream, expressing the terror of the experience is nearly impossible. /asterisk_dot_jpg]

40. You see a marketplace, and there you realize the cost of a common fruit has increased by exactly 0.37104 copper. There is no discernible reason why. /NotAplicable]

41. You see a rather frustrated gnome standing on the porch of a house in a quiet town. He has locked himself out of his own home, and is desperately trying to get the attention of his roommate. /NotAplicable]

43. You have a vision of yourself having a vision. There is nothing noteworthy about yourself or the environment. /Splendidissimus]

45. A humanoid enters a dark house and removes their hat; you have seen this person once before in your life, but don't really know them. As they light a lamp, a dozen voices suddenly yell out 'Surprise!' and 'Happy birthday!'. /Splendidissimus]

46.Three ducks are sitting on a pond, one quacking loudly at the other two before pausing for emphasis. The other ducks sit in silence for a moment before bursting into raucous human-like laughter. /No-Guard-8089]

48. You witness, in a moment that stretches for hours, the entire life of a fruit fly from it's point of view. /No-Guard-8089]

49. A sheep. A hill. A man. A tub of lard. The vision fades before you see how these things are put to use. /No-Guard-8089]

50. You see yourself, sitting down in a tavern with a beer saying 'Well, I'm glad that all blew over'. /Revexious]

51. You see a dead man on the ground, another person by its side is cleaning a knife covered in blood. You hear them say 'Let's see you take the master's cheese again'. /Waste-of-Bagels]

52. You see an elven man walking down the street beside what appears to be his pet bear. They pass in front of a large orphanage and before they realize it the two have been swarmed by children with snotty noses and sticky fingers. All chanting 'big doggy!' /Skrubasauras]

53. You see still blackness, however, you can hear the sounds of heavy, steady breathing. The sounds reverberate inside what you believe is some kind of cavern. Then, just before the vision fades, you begin to see light. It illuminates the inside of the cave, casting wild dancing shadows and reflects off of pure white scales of some gigantic, slumbering beast. /Skrubasauras]

54. You see a full blooded orc holding a bag of gold. You watch as he examines it, seemingly trying to decipher it's true nature or perhaps it's value. Then you see him give up his investigation with a sigh as he pitches the hefty pouch at an ignorant goblin's head. /Skrubasauras]

55. You see a crowd of people gathered to one side of a mighty battle between a great dragon and a noble knight. However, something is wrong: the crowd seems to be in shadows while the sun is shining right at them, the dragon is definitely not supposed to bleed that colour, and the knight's sword looks awfully dull and tarnished to be able to even scratch a dragon. /Robosium]

56. You contemplate a street performer dancing and singing in the middle of a street. A crowd has gathered to enjoy the show. You notice several shady characters blended in the crowd, pickpocketing strangers while they are distracted. /NecessaryCornflake7]

57. You watch a small family in their dilapidated home. The mother is helping the baby stand on its feet and encourages it to walk to the father.

The parents immediately show expressions of surprise, joy, and tears of happiness as they encourage and celebrate this special moment with their child. /NecessaryCornflake7]

58. You see a town leader as they end their busy day. The external demeanor shifts from a stern seriousness to a light hearted joy as they enter their private quarters.

They ask their servants to bring in the puppets and candy as they sit in a cushioned chair beside the fireplace. /NecessaryCornflake7]

59. The vision zooms into a group of homeless as they discuss what they collected for the day.

69. A baby is sleeping peacefully on his cradle. The window opens itself and a fairy with a baby on her arms enters the room. She swaps the two children and leaves, closing the window. The last thing you see is the baby in the cradle crying and 'his' mother coming to comfort him. /Sandro2017]

70. You see a loud ally of you floating through the astral plane while shouting 'This is totally awesome!'. /evtrax]

71. You see a tired looking woman cradling a newly born baby in her arms. It's a quiet, peaceful night. The moon has risen high above the pine trees, its gentle glow the only source of light within the chamber. There is nothing else but the sound of chirping crickets and the soft hum of the mother's lullaby. Before your vision fades, she smiles softly and hugs her child close. /inkyfeathers]

72. Your vision opens to the sight of a wide muddy street out of town. A local farmers' merchant is yelling at a family of geese crossing and blocking the road. /inkyfeathers]

73. Two old grumpy-looking men are playing chess in a local park. They play silently as the player of the black chess pieces moves his rook. A moment passes between them, a spring breeze gently blows past. Just as your vision fades, the other player loudly sighs. /inkyfeathers]

74. You see a magnificent silver dragon at a birthday party, wearing a strange hat, eating a piece of cake. /InfectedAstronaut]

75. The smell hits you before the vision. Firewood, warm vanilla and the hint of mothballs. Sitting by low fireplace is a woman, swathed in quilts, sobbing deeply into her hands. Approaching quickly is a large elderly woman, wiping her hand on her apron as she holds a large mug of thick hot cocoa. Placing the mug down and kneeling before the girl, she cradles her tear-streaked cheeks,'Oh dearest...' she whispers, 'I'm sorry he wasn't the one...'. /inkyfeathers]

76. You see a boy climbing out his window in the dead of night, holding a small bag wrapped in cloth. He tiptoes to the edge of the treeline, calling out a name.

8.	Foumart is red and dusty, but small oases of life exist. Think fast, though—these are seasonal ponds, and when they dry up, the life goes dormant.(Arseniccattails)
9.	The gas giant Bêtise has a few habitable moons—but you crashed on the least resource rich one.(Arseniccattails)
10. An egg shaped planet with no equatorial rotation. The side facing the sun is a molten, toxic wasteland. The other side is frozen and dark at all times. There is a narrow habitable band in the middle.(zenerift)
11. The proximity of the two hyper-extreme climates makes the narrow band prone to intense storm systems that can race across the land at the speed of a freight train, devastating anything not built to withstand hurricane-sized tornados.(DazedPapacy)
12. Turns out that it's not a planet at all. It's a cosmic ant colony drifting through space like army ants in a flood. Maybe they're intelligent. Maybe they're starving. Maybe they immediately start to drag your ship into their center mass upon landing.(Lovecraftian)
13. \-Truman Show Planet. The party crashes and a benevolent and egalitarian society. Everyone is so excited to have them. They're hiding something though.

However, the transition is so seamless, the characters never realize it, at first. The purpose is the core of the planet (which is actually a sentient AI) is studying creatures of the universe for some ulterior purpose (maybe to defeat them or create a galactic zoo.).

9. Sword of light. Weighs 1 tenth of expected weight.

10. The bag that holds. Cursed item, roll DC20 vs grapple to remove hand, check daily.

11. Cloak of elevenkind. Take any roll, once per day: it was actually an eleven.

12. The Case & Point: a collapsible spear fully contained within a small box.

13. Fencing Sword: Requires attunement, Once a day you can cast wall of stone using as an action. If you do so the wall is made of wood instead of stone, and is vulnerable to fire damage.

14. Attuning Fork(A tuning Fork): (requires attunement) Hitting this fork against an item that requires attunement causes the Attuning Fork to instantly unattune and the hit item to attune to you. If you attempt this on an item that is already attuned to someone, you must first hit the item with an attack roll then make contested charisma checks. If you win the check the item attunes to you instead. If used on a cursed item, that prevents unattunement the Attuning fork instead lets out a piercing note and becomes unusable for 1d4 days.

15. Aware wolf figurine( A werewolf figurine): As an action summons a wolf with a 20 intelligence, wisdom and charisma. The wolf can speak all languages. The wolf functions as a commune spell with significant but not omniscient awareness of the situation at hand. The wolf lasts until all 3 questions are asked and answered before reverting to smoke. The figurine can be used to summon this wolf again after 2d4 days. If the wolf dies before it finishes answering questions the figurine becomes nonmagical.

16. Memory Foam Pillow : A pillow which is surprisingly uncomfortable. A creature that sleeps on this pillow has a advantage on history checks the next day. If the user has been affected by the modify memory spell, the real memories are restored.

17. Ring of 3 Wishes: Inscribed on this silver ring are the names of three NPC’s chosen by the DM. Each of the NPC’s has a wish inscribed upon the ring. If all three wishes come true, the user can cast the wish spell once. After the spell is cast, then names of 3 new individuals appear on the ring. Hidden fact: if an NPC dies their name is removed from the list and replaced by a new one with a different wish. The wishes always are divided such that one wish belongs to an evil creature, one to a good creature, and one to a neutral creature.

18. Wet stone (Whetstone): This stone is perpetually dripping a small amount of water. Over the course of a day it will have produced 1 liter of water. If the stone is cracked open it summons a water elemental that is hostile towards all creatures it can see.

19. Arcane Vibe Rater (arcane vibrator): when activated wand vibrates at different speeds based on the magical auras. While holding the wand you can use an action to detect the presence of magic within 10 ft of you. If magic is detected you know what schools of magic are present but not their sources. The wand does not discriminate known items meaning it often triggers off the other items the user holds. (I bet the bard buys this one first)

20. Divine Vibe Rater (divine vibrator): when activated this ""wand"" vibrates so fast that it blurs, becoming an illusory divine figure (one that seems somehow a little voyeuristic and perverted, in ways that only make sense to the viewers mind). This illusory NPC will now follow the party, occasionally rating the vibe - especially if there are performances or other interesting skill checks occurring. Vibe checks, normally considered subjective, are totally objective as they are divine in source: the divine connection of the figure being whatever god the caster worship.

21. Wand of High Touch Ee. Use of this wand can alleviate ailments and states such as fear, panic, confusion, and hysteria.

32. Potion of piece of mind. A common snack sold in Illithid vending machines, how this found it's way into the market you have no idea. Use of this potion is an evil action, if the character knows the true nature of the source of the potion (literally: a piece of someone's mind). Grants +2 intelligence, wisdom, and charisma for 1 hour. Using such potions more than once per week causes psychoses such as berserker rage, visions indistinguishable from reality, etc.

33. Potion of baited breath. Upon breathing out this mixture in a 30ft cone, targets in area of effect make dc20 willpower check or become confused for 1d4 rounds. Targets can recheck skill each round. Upon the effect ending they must move to attack the user of the potion.

36. The Pedal-Stool - personal vehicle providing +20 speed, but can only be activated by someone who has been recently given high praise.

37. Ring of Ass Burgers. Allows wearer to cast create food once per long rest: provides a platter of donkey meat burgers with any toppings the character can possibly imagine. (RAW this one, let it be abused).

38. Scroll of summon Lucidfir. You were expecting to deal with the devil, what appears is a lawful evil sentient tree (Ent, Groot, etc)

39. Amulet of Poisson^distribution resistance. (Say the word distribution quietly, quickly, and NEVER acknowledge it). Wearer is now immune to all effects that cause a re-roll, whether these effects would have been positive or negative. (So an enemy lucky halfling would find their luck failing vs the wearer, but also if the wearer was a lucky halfling... no more rerolls)

40. Wand of One 'derr. When activated all allies within one mile hear, psychically, a vaguely moronic intonation of ""derrr""

If kept by the party, the DM must stop referring to the adventure as “Lost Mines” and refer to its proper singular form.

56. Another Think Coming A trinket that when given to someone else causes them to fail the next Intelligence Check/Saving throw.

57. Wand of Wreck Havoc A magical wand that cancels out an undesirable wild magic effect. It has 4 charges and renews 1d4 charges at dawn. If all charges are expended, the wand explodes and wreaks havoc. Roll on the Wild Magic surge table for the effect.

47,"1. Infighting: The Demon Prince that wants to invade is being sabotaged by multiple other Demon Princes.

2. Infighting: The Demon Prince that wants to invade can't keep loyal generals to keep their Hordes organized 

3. Infighting: The Demon Prince that wants to invade is delayed by generals challenging them for power every day.

4. Incompetence: The Hordes with the power to invade can't agree on the order of troops, causing lethal 3 stooges effects literally blocking up any gate.

5. Incompetence: The Demon Prince with the power wastes it, chaotically changing their method of invasion. 

6. Higher Priority: The Demon Prince is too busy maintaining control over their layer of the Abyss.

7. Higher Priority: The Demon Prince is successfully sending their Hordes to a world devoid of life that houses a Shard of Essence of something from a prior reality that is so powerful, even the rebirth of the universe did not destroy it. However, so are a thousand other Demon Lords, all throwing billions of demonic bodies at the goal, creating a hellish Red Spot of stagnent carnage visible from space.

8. Higher Priority: The Demon Prince that wants to invade already has their countless Hordes tied up in the Bloodwar.

9. Biding Time: The Demon Prince that wants to invade has their countless Hordes tied up in the Bloodwar, and are in the middle of a plan to force another Demon Prince to send their Hordes in their place.

10. Biding Time: The Demon Prince that wants to invade has a plan in action, but the stars are not aligned to allow their Hordes to hijack the Rainbow Bridge.

11. The barrier between our world and the Abyss is too strong for them to come thru. YET! /Adventux

12. Fear: They see what those living in the world have created and they want no part of it. /The_Twilight_Filter

13. Laziness: quite frankly, demons have no work ethic. Their progress on the dimensional gate keeps stalling out. /I_m_different

14. Bigger fish: the demon prince is more focused on winning the blood war and the mortal realms are just a recruiting ground. /Teisted_medal

15. Low profile: a full scale demonic invasion might incite a full scale angelic crusade, but small bites go mostly unchecked. /Teisted_medal

16. Bad PR: demons of the prince corrupt souls on the material plane, but are seen as wish fulfillers by the masses. Invasion would ruin the troves of commoners who surrender their soul willingly. /Teisted_medal

17. A single entity wandering the material plane is acting as a key stone preventing the demon from penetrating the barrier between worlds. /JPreadsyourstuff

18. Training needed: The demon prince's minions keep placing demonic portals in bad or dead end places and the demon prince is having to focus on training his inexperienced demons. /NecessaryCornflake7

19. Contract Perfection: The demon prince has been stuck for several hundred years on a particular wording in several contracts he has been working on and wants it to be perfect. /NecessaryCornflake7

20. Distracted Lover: The demon prince fell in love with a mortal and keeps using critical portal energy to go see him/her and the others haven't figured it out yet. /NecessaryCornflake7

21. Contract gone wrong: A demon had accidentally misworded a signed contract to promise no demon horde invasion to the material plane anytime soon. The demon princes were furious and have made a public spectacle of the demon's failure and are working to reverse it if possible. /NecessaryCornflake7

22. Analysis Paralysis: Have been spending most of their time studying and planning for the Hordes invasion, but there is too much disagreement on the best course of action and overall strategy. /NecessaryCornflake7

23. Long Forgotten: The critical information to create gates have been lost and forgotten. The demon princes are having to start from scratch and relearn how to do it. /NecessaryCornflake7

24. Peacekeeping: The demon princes are getting tired of sending the Hordes and wants a break to relax, maybe there is a change of mind. /NecessaryCornflake7

25. Celestial Invasion: The celestials have taken the battle to the Abyss, they are diverting all attention and resources to the defense of their home. /NecessaryCornflake7

26. Equal Rights: The Hordes of the abyss are wanting better pay and benefits before they accept the terms to another invasion of the material plane. The demon princes are scrambling to make them happy or invoke proper fear of their obedience. /NecessaryCornflake7

27. Equipment Shortage: They are rebuilding equipment and supply for the effort and need more time. /NecessaryCornflake7

28. Celestial Influence: The celestial's power in the material plane has grown too strong, the demon princes are thinking twice about the next invasion. /NecessaryCornflake7

29. Dumb luck: Creating the gates and traveling through them requires a specific set of circumstances that have just not happened yet. /donutmelon

30. Strategic Ambiguity. The demons have the power to invade at any time, and have demonstrated it more than once in order to gain concessions from those in power on the material plane. The concessions are too good and they don't want to kill this golden goose. /squintdawg

31. Viability: While it is nearly impossible for a Demon to go from the abyss to Material Realm on their own, there are a few spells that can summon Demons onto the Material realm. The one that would allow the greatest number of Demons is the 9th level Gate spell, which only lasts a minute, and very few people can even cast. Those that can cast the spell know better than to do so. /nomad-knight

32. Efficiency: It would seem the mortal realms are tearing themselves apart almost as well as the demons could. It's just enough to keep them entertained. Barely. /sapper501

33. Revolution among the Hordes decided screw the monarchy overthrew it and now they all live in a peaceful democracy that has twonparties that can vote together to decide to invade. Need 2/3 majority but stay gridlocked as protesters go on about rights to live. /axcrms

34. The material plane we know is another plane of the abyss, they aren’t all that interested. /pistolography

35. Control: The demons are being held captive and their captor is waiting to use them. /jex4life

36. Dimensional Alignment: The conditions that allow a (bridge, stable portal) between the two realms only occurs once every millennia or perhaps longer. There is still a few hundred years to go, before the next invasion. /world_of_ideas

37. Fear: The last horde to enter the portal vanished without a trace. The Demon Lord doesn't want to wast any more resources until they can figure out what happened. /world_of_ideas

38. Incompetent Cultist: The cultist in the material plane seem to be just too stupid to complete the ritual that would bridge the two realms. What the demon lords wouldn't give for just one semi-competent cultist. /world_of_ideas

39. Infernal Apocalypse: Something really bad has happened to Hell. Very few demons have survived this event. The few who are left are worried more about survival than invasion. /world_of_ideas

40. Thief: Someone keeps stealing a critical component of the gateway. It can't be opened without this component. /world_of_ideas 

41. Vacation Spot: The mortal ream is actually a nice vacation spot. It would be a shame to destroy it an turn it into another hell. /world_of_ideas

42. Proxy War: The demons understand that total war with the celestial plane right now would be the end of all things and neither of them are willing to all-out invade neutral realms right now. Instead, they're sending trainers, supplies, and money to two ideologically opposed halves of mortal nations engaged in civil war to secure a sphere of influence. /IceMaverick13

43. Logistical Issues: Who knew that demons had trouble with making the trains run on time? Turns out that bringing the infinite hordes of the Abyss into the mortal realm requires a lot of equipment and proper stockpiles haven't been made. /IceMaverick13

44. Cultural Shift: Rather than war, famine, and death to all mortal creatures, the demons have had a shift in their zeitgeist and realize that exploiting the resources of the other realms leads to greater gains for themselves. The last few years have seen demons fashioning a mercantile multi-dimensional empire. /IceMaverick13

45. Prophetic Misinterpretation: They've believed for years that it was a single chosen mortal's existence that prevented them from breaching the barrier between worlds, but it was discovered that it's actually the power of a demon among them holding them back. Finding that individual amongst the infinite hordes is proving challenging. /IceMaverick13

46. Caught Flatfooted: When the mortal realm heard about the impending invasion from the Abyss, they began to mobilize. Fast. Much faster than the demon hordes possibly could. Now the demons are hastily devising defenses as mortals find increasingly successful ways to pre-emptively invade the Abyss. /IceMaverick13

47. Appeasement Crisis: The demons marched into the mortal realm in a southern kingdom and just took it, like that, with no resistance. They were welcomed in. Boom. This is demon land now. Next they wanted a strip of land in a bordering nation containing many citizens that consider themselves dark wizards, and the other nations got together and decided to let them have it on the condition they sign a contract promising they won't invade the rest of the nation they're taking the land from. /IceMaverick13

48. Weapons of Mass Demonization: The demons are working on a bomb, bigger than any other bomb ever conceived. And they're curious to see if it works. So, they're delaying their invasion until they can finish making it. /IceMaverick13

49. Immunization Problems: Coming from such different lands, the demons encountered microbial life that their forms had never had to contend with before and this strain is surprisingly potent in demonic entities. The invasion has stalled out while they try to eradicate the plague that's now sweeping through them. /IceMaverick13

50. Inflexible Doctrine: While numerically, physically, and capably stronger than any mortal force in existence, the woefully outdated doctrines the current Demon Prince uses to conduct his invasion has left them strategically inflexible and they're being stalled out by defenses at every portal they open. /IceMaverick13

51. Cautious Commanders: The leading Demon Prince in charge of the invasion ruthlessly punishes mistakes or actions he disagrees with. The punishments have gotten so bad that the demons he put in charge of commanding his forces are overly cautious of doing anything lest they incur the Prince's wrath. /IceMaverick13

52. The League of Dimensions: An accord between all extra-dimensional entities was signed after the last great conflict, limiting the actions that any of them can take to interfere with mortals. The bureaucratic troubles of avoiding breaching the contracts they signed is getting snarled up in the Demon Prince's court and they're trying to find a loophole to justify invasion without bringing every other realm into the war in response. /IceMaverick13

53. Harsh Mortal Conditions: The hordes of the demons are not suited to the climate of the mortal realm. Improper training, equipment, and supply line issues means that they're leaving demons to die on the sides of roads as they're lost to the drastically different conditions compared to their homelands and the constant drain on their forces is exceeding the number that can pass through the portal in the same time period. /IceMaverick13

54. Demonpower Shortages: After the last great war, the Demon Princes introduced the DI-Bill, which saw the hordes who fought that war - and their immediate kin - able to retire in a nice stalactite community and get a princely education with promises to not be called back to war except in dire circumstances requiring their conscription. Most of the hordes were eligible and have since found cushy black-collar jobs working in a court somewhere. The Demon Princes have realized that the program is subtracting many demons from the hordes as Infinity Minus One - done infinite times - does eventually create less-than-infinite hordes. The Princes are reluctant to invoke that conscription clause in the contract because the now-capable and educated populace might simply oust them from their positions. /IceMaverick13

55. Don't feel like it - They have taken over so many worlds and planes at the point that adding another waste with pitiful resistance seems like a chore. /mcdeathcore

56. bad weather - the weather is so anti demon, no hellfire or oceans of lava that taking the material plane would just be pointless. Perhaps it could be used as a prison planet for demons they don't like. /mcdeathcore

57. Space - The infinite Hordes obviously need infinite space to live. The material plane is kinda like jeff the demon's backyard by comparison and not worth conquest. /mcdeathcore

58. Competition - The agreed-upon force that would take the material plane was the winner of the conflict between each other. Who knew that winning a war with an infinite Hordes against an infinite Hordes would take so long. /mcdeathcore

59. Sloth - The current leader of the demons is a demon of sloth. They will get around to taking the mortal world when he stops procrasinating. /mcdeathcore

60. Honour: it would be far too easy to invade, the demons see the people as inferior and there would be no glory in it. That doesn’t mean there aren’t exceptions who don’t have this sense of honour. /ottersintuxedos

61. Prophecy: the demonic invasion was foretold to a certain time and diverting from fate feels like breaking tradition. /ottersintuxedos

62. Demons can't stay on the Material plane very long because the vital energy that animates them is only present in the Abyss. /Fony64

63. Volunteers should step forward. Whomever starts the attack will be exposing their back to all the others vying for power. /MisterCheesy

64. Prison: the classic reason. Hell is the prison where devils and demons were cast after losing the war in heaven. They are locked up by divine power. /atomfullerene

65. Incapable: Its not possible to launch a mass invasion, the laws of magic dont allow such a portal to exist. /DonQuixoteDesciple

66. Wards: Long ago a cabal of arch-mages created hexagrammatic wards that prevent mass incursions. The wards are very well protected in dungeons. /DonQuixoteDesciple

67. A long trip: To get to the mostly Neutral realm of man, demons need to first get through the CN realm, and the NE realm. Each would be its own crusade. /DonQuixoteDesciple

68. Harrowing Journey: Demons sent through the portal come out critically weakened and limited from their previous forms. Leaving them easy(ish) pickings for mortal armies. /DonQuixoteDesciple

69. Ritual: The local blacksmith has a gambling problem. He believes that tapping his hammer three times on his anvil at noon every day brings him good luck. It doesn't. But it does resonate with an underground artifact that keeps a planar barrier charged and active. /Incognito87

70. Ticket Please: Penetrating the barriers surrounding the abyss incurs a cost - sacrifices, souls, a certain amount of evil deeds done by mortals outside, collected magical energies, etc. ""No ticket."" /CountofAccount

71. Mortal needed: A mortal soul (disembodied will do nicely) is required for a demon to remain outside the abyss, sometimes multiples for stronger demons. This limits the amount of demons that can invade to the amount of souls that can be trapped, and also gives them a weak point that is soul cages that can be destroyed to send the demons back. (I have used this idea before. It's great fun.) /CountofAccount

72. Where's the exit⁈: Leaving the abyss without a summoner or special limited-access gate requires each demon to individually navigate a spiritual maze. The more demons leaving, the harder it is to navigate correctly. Only a handful succeed, which is why it's really annoying for a demon to get cast back into the abyss. /CountofAccount

73. Eat to live and live to eat: The demon must continuously consume mortal lives (or suffering) to remain out of the abyss, and even with tricks to reduce feeding needs like corrupting the landscape or possession, murdering people at scale required to sustain a whole army of demons starts to run into the logistical problem of sustained mass murder (or miserableness - people are liable to die if continuously unhappy). /CountofAccount

74. Farming: The demons have long since realized that a full-scale of the Material Plane would really just be too much work, and are content to have their cultists farm souls for them. /80s4evah

75. Farming: The demons have long since realized that a full-scale of the Material Plane would really just be too much work, and are content to have their cultists farm souls for them. /80s4evah

76. Distraction: Their best strategist is busy running a long term Humans & Offices Campaign. And the players keep going so far off the Rails that he keeps having to make new content for them. /InuGhost

77. Bribery: Turns out that there are items in the Material Plane that are certainly worth bargaining for. And that's kept them safe for the last 30 odd years. /InuGhost

78. It's Monday. Seriously you want us to do what today? Yeah just try to get Demogorgon out of bed earlier than eight this evening. Comeback tomorrow. /NeoBlue42

79. Difficulty- rending holes in the material plane isn't as easy as one might think, and few think such a thing is easy. Astrological considerations, ancient artifacts, rare and unwieldy magic, mortal complicity, lapses in the eternal vigil of perfidious do-gooders AND opposed forces of evil, and possibly more must like up just so for even the opportunity of an invasion. /DavidECloveast

80. Divine Power- Gods can still squash demons like a bugs. Hell, they usually send flunkies, usually MORTAL flunkies, to stomp out pockets of evil. Unless the gods are trapped in aspect forms for some reason or somehow managed to get themselves killed, they can wipe an army, even a demonic one, off the face of the material plane without breaking a sweat. /DavidECloveast

81. Inhospitality- Where's the sulfurous smog? The lakes of fire and acid? Princes in hell, is that SUNLIGHT?!? If demons are going to spend any appreciable time on the material plane, some significant abysa-forming will need to take place some time before or immediately after the opening of the invasion, which the demons are not coordinated to do. /DavidECloveast

82. Second Front- The last demonic invasion that went through was concurrent with a invasion of devils into the Abyss, stealing demonic toys and knocking over their sandcastles wile their enemies were busy in the material plane. The demons will have to puzzle out a solution to this if they don't want to lose more than they gain. /DavidECloveast

83. Cold Feet: The demons prefer the boiling air of the infernal plane over the freezing temperature of the material plane. /NecessaryCornflake7

84. Unholy Alliance?: The rulers of the material plane made an agreement with the demon princes, as long as they keep their end of the bargain there will be no demon invasion. /NecessaryCornflake7

85. The hordes of the abyss don't realize that the portals all lead to the same material plane. Due to the diversity of biomes and cultures on the end of the portals, the consensus is that each one grants passage to a small demiplane not worth the effort of a full invasion.  /_medmed_

86. Awareness: While individual demons have been summoned to the material plane, their accounts of their experience are treated much like alien abduction stories in our world. Scrying works from ours to theirs, but not in reverse, and last they had any extensive contact with our material plane, it had no intelligent life or resources worth exploiting. They've just founded SEPI, though, so that might change soon. /kelltain

87. Autonomy: They have the raw ability, but as instruments of torture for the damned, they lack mortal ambition or consciousness. If an outside power were capable of dominating them, they could be put to other purposes, but on their own, they only take actions that create suffering for mortal souls that end up in their realm by natural metaphysical happenstance, and arguably are incapable of choice to begin with. /kelltain

88. Redundancy: They aren't interested because they already invaded, millennia ago, and took anything they would have wanted. The material plane is fundamentally broken because of this looting, although no one in the modern world is quite sure of exactly how. /kelltain

89. Infinity: They are actually constantly invading other planes. It's just that this material plane is one of an infinite number, so short of being actively called to specifically this one, it's infinitely unlikely to happen in any given slice of time. /kelltain

90. Misidentification: There actually is no infinite horde of the abyss, that's simply another material plane that's been at war with the 'divine' ever since a failed annexation a few hundred years ago. Pulling anything out of this plane--information, natives, or material--inherently warps it to seem more sinister than it actually is on its home plane, just from the mechanics of the plane's periphery. They have been trying to establish mundane trade, it's just they always get misunderstood as wanting people's souls, and celestial propaganda is working to isolate them pretty well. /kelltain

91. Fundamental Nature: Demons, by definition, are too petty and spiteful to coordinate a mass invasion of another plane. Strategic decisions necessary for any invasion to come together require demons to act in a way ultimately fundamentally in conflict with their nature. The necessary first steps have happened a few times, but they always just end up ravaging the immediate area too severely to maintain a connection. /kelltain

92. Wrong Turn: The opening of the portal to our realm was shunted down the chain of command to poorly trained minimum wage fiends, and now the hellish forces are invading some other plane mistakenly believing it to be ours /JJ273

93. The Demon Prince promised a little girl that he would not invade until after she passes. He did not realize she was an Immortal... /Adventux"

Hidden fact: if an NPC dies their name is removed from the list and replaced by a new one with a different wish. The wishes always are divided such that one wish belongs to an evil creature, one to a good creature, and one to a neutral creature. /cybermage99](
16. Wet stone (Whetstone): This stone is perpetually dripping a small amount of water. Over the course of a day it will have produced 1 liter of water. If the stone is cracked open it summons a water elemental that is hostile towards all creatures it can see. /cybermage99](

32. Amulet of Poissondistribution resistance. (Say the word distribution quietly, quickly, and NEVER acknowledge it).

It has a movement speed of 20' that is not restricted by terrain or verticality, as long as it has a surface it can move along it (even the underside of a cavern roof).

64. A frayed knot. Activating this enchanted but innocuous looking piece of worn rope allows the player to cancel the effects of any single dice roll. It could be an attack roll against your character that critical hit for massive damage (you have to cancel the action immediately, otherwise the best you could do if you allow the damage to be rolled would be to cancel the damage die and force a re-roll), or it could be used to cancel... anything.

65. Lucky Wolf's Foot. Allows you to Paws Time. This acts as the classic spell timestop but all canine type creatures (dogs, wolves, werewolves, gnolls, etc) are free to act for 1 round. The first creature to take offensive action cancels the effect.

91. Civil Serpent. This familiar grants +3 to diplomacy checks and to knowledge (beuracracy). Grants the Wizard speak language (lawyer). 
92. Jug of Passing Mustard: Whenever you find your food unsatisfactory, you can use an action to expend a charge, which creates mustard so tasty, that it makes one portion of food more than passable. The jug has maximum of 10 charges and it gains 1d4 charges at dawn. When the charges drop to 0, the mustard gets all used up and it can not regenerate.
93. Yahkar's War & Tea. ""War"" is a +2 spear, if pointed at a creature on a successful touch attack you gain +20 to survival checks to track, allowing you to pursue. Tea is a dagger made from a shard of the plane of tea and can bypass all damage reduction (except DR: Tea) and is returning when thrown. They were brought together when Yahkar, a fish and chip salesman, closed the portal to the plane of tea that was draining the oceans. When used together the become extended war and tea, granting reach of 15' with both weapons.
94. Shopkeepers ""War and Tea"". When you offer certain shopkeepers the players may think they are being offered a warranty on the items they are purchasing.

95. Dagger-o-type: A +1 dagger that once per day, can transcribe 1 spell per owner’s level from any spell book to another, blank spell book or scroll. (Daguerreotype, an early photography technique).
96. Magical Loot: this nondescript item can be turned into any one magical item from the DMG for Five Minutes (DM has final say). It has all the properties of the magical item (including race, class, and potential attunement requirements) and full charges. After the five minutes has expired, it loses it's magical qualities and falls into worthless scraps.
97. Staff of Infinity Charges: This Staff allows the user to charge as far as they can see. They must attempt an attack on a target that is within sight and will move the distance to that target. If they hit, they will deal normal damage for the charge. If they miss, they will continue charging until they hit an obstruction or run out of ground on which to charge (in which case they run off the edge and begin to fall). Running at an object and hitting it at this speed deals 1d6 damage for every 30 feet after an initial 30 feet. (So no damage until 60 feet have been run, then it is 1d6 for every 30 feet run) This ability does not grant you any additional attacks.
98. Rod of Coop de Grass. Make a chicken coop where you are. On activation on a flat surface, the rod expands into a 10x10ft chicken coop, with steel mesh and grass.
99. Chick Magnet Amulet. Summon 2d4 chickens, permanently, once per long rest.
100. **Glasses of Perfect Site:** These ordinary field glasses (binoculars) can be used to find the perfect camping site. This will have the best available fire wood, wind protection, ground for sleeping, good drainage, and if possible cover. It will also account for potential traps, ambushes, or inherent dangers (Using a Passive Perception of 27). It has 5 Charges and each use will expend one charge. It regains 1d4+1 charges on a Long Rest, but if the last charge is used, it loses all magical properties.
101. **Crown of Long Rain:** This crown is enchanted to ensure that any and all rains are long and plentiful. Probably by a poor spelling Wizard. All rain storms, rain showers, gentle rains, and harsh rains within 100 miles of the Crown are doubled in length and volume.
102. **Cat of Amontillado.** A small brown and grey tabby cat. It can expel wine multiple times per day of a the best vintage if a goblet, flask, mug, glass, or appropriate vessel is placed before it. The cat will begin to convulse, gag, and eventually expel the liquid until the container is full or roughly a pint has been released. There is a 50% chance that the cat will promptly knock the glass over if it is on table, ledge, or other surface off the ground. A DC 18 Dexterity check can grab the vessel before it is knocked over.  
The cat will ignore all verbal commands, however it will stay within one mile of the owner at all times. It can be summoned by opening a small metal can or shaking a bag filled with dried food. It will also randomly approach the owner and cuddle, but has a 10% chance of randomly biting for no fucking reason. This increases to 90% if it's belly is rubbed.

It has a basement that can be used to store food. Three times a month on the day (24 hours) of a full moon and the day before and after, it turns into a normal commoner named Steve. Steve is aware of his condition and is willing to be home to the party, as long as they make sure to keep him safe and well fed while he's Steve.  
Steve prefers to change into the House somewhere quiet and fairly scenic so that he has something to look at while he's a House. The process of turning into Steve is quite traumatic as the house expels everything inside of it, *violently*, during the change so Steve will get angry if any belongings not belonging to Steve are left inside. Anything owned by Steve does transform with him however.
104. Were Wolf. Successful casting of this scroll against will save rewrites history so that the target, for the last day, was actually a wolf. Everyone remembers it as such, no-one questions it.
105. Where Wolf. Divination to find all wolves within 1 mile. Wolves that are actively avoiding being found must pass opposed will save.

39. The Mean Girls: A trio of ladies bad mouths a member of the party from a distance, giggling behind their fans. They might even splash their drinks at them if approached. Should the aggrieved rise to the provocation, its revealed that they are a trio of witches and sorceresses, who can afford to bully even seasoned adventurers.

40. Assassin's Red Flag: This person is obviously an amateur assassin, their suit/dress bulges with ""hidden"" weapons and clanks when they walk. They can be seen awkwardly trying to fit in with the other guests, who are obviously aware but trying not to bring attention to it.

41. Well one of us has to change: A noble came to the ball wearing the same outfit as on of the adventuring party (no matter how absurd said member's get up) and is offended. Still, said noble might be useful for framing if the party plays their cards right.

42. Wild Magic Ball: The drinks at the ball are all served in individual glasses, each with a random (but mostly harmless) potion mixed in for some surprise fun. Should things go sideways, the drinks table can be smashed to create a massive puddle of wildmagic that fires off random magic effects around the hall.

43. The nice lady who was dancing with the prince has disappeared leaving just a shoe, did anyone see where she went?

44. The card shark. A low-key figure in a world of flamboyant and cocky rouges who cheats at games of chance. It's a living, he's putting in his time tonight.

51. The Mocking Toast: before dinner, every noble at the high table gets to deliver a short, rhymed ""toast"" aimed at other nobles. Those can be accusations, mocking, or otherwise offensive - the target can defend with their own rhymed reply, and as long as it is witty, no honor is lost. The winner (and truth of the accusations, if any) is decided by who gets the most cheering. 

52. The Sponsor: someone had to vouch for the PCs to get them through the gate. The Sponsor looks to close a (deal / marriage / handover) at the party with a member of another family, and brought the PCs as a distraction. Thus, the PCs must cause some upset, but not embarrass the Sponsor. 

53. The Rival: a grizzled (matron / veteran general / eternal second-in-command) of a rival faction. The Rival looks to embarrass the Sponsor or party by accusing them of (impropriety / cowardice / sympathy for the commoners) during the mocking toast session. The PCs must find out the content before the toast is delivered, so that their sponsor can prepare an answer. Either that, or they get the Rival drunk.

54. A distraught lady-in-waiting who has just heard that her love interest (a rival noble's lady-in-waiting / manservant) has been sent to accompany their noble on a year-long journey, so they won't be able to announce their engagement on the spring celebration as per tradition. Will the PCs help her bringing at least a letter to the love interest? 

55. Two rivaling troupes of entertainers lobbying the master of ceremonies over who gets the time slot for the after-dinner wine-drinking entertainment. One of the factions is allied with the PC's sponsor's rival, so the PCs can lower the rival's standing by first making sure those artists get the slot, and then sabotage them. Maybe there is a convenient cage of monkeys whose lock needs to be loosened a bit? 

56. Stressed-out server who just heard that his wife went into labor and wants to go home. He will give a PC his keys and uniform if they take over the rest of his shift. It's a hard couple of hours, but it grants access to a lot of back passages and a stealth field on the floor - it's not like any of the higher-ups remember the server's face anyways. 

57. A soothsayer who predicted a good harvest last year, leading to profits for an attending rich trader family. They have not paid her yet, and she has returned to publicly shame them into paying. If the PCs can help her delivering her accusation (preventing that the merchant's bodyguard drags her off before she can finish), she will bless the party with a luck charm for the rest of the evening.

58. The invitations have invisible magical markings so the invite-checkers with special lenses can immediately tell when one is foraged. if the party knows of this, certainly another crasher does not. 

59. A noblewoman has lost her ring down the sink drain...a priceless heirloom she will do anything to get back!

63. An infamous cat burglar who was going to break into the treasury vault while everyone was in the ballroom. But a senile old spinster noble woman is convinced the burglar is her crush from her youth and dances the night away with the burglar.

64. A vampire has infiltrated the ball, looking to drink the blood of a virgin. Doesn’t matter if they’re male or female, just as long as they’re a virgin. He keeps sniffing around everyone to determine who’s a virgin. He plans to turn that person into a vampire once he’s done.

65. An impromptu game of poker between some drunken nobles. They'll accept any joiners, but are looking for more exciting stakes than just money.

66. A speed-painter offers to paint your portrait in ten minutes. However, he was hired by a hateful noble and has a list of that noble's enemies. If your name is on the list, you'll find your portrait to be rather unflattering.

67. A pauper for the prince. One of the party members is the spitting image of the long missing prince/princess. People treat them with hushed whispers and stares to outright 'prodigal son returns' vibes.

68. There is sizeable opium den filled with the lazy nobles that is ignored by polite society. A contact that you need to meet at the ball is in the den.

69. The Diplomat. A wildly dressed contingent that claim to be from a distant land and are traveling here as emissaries of a king no one has heard of.

70. The youngest prince dreams of abandoning his title and hitting the road as a bard. Like really badly. Like he clocks you as an adventurer and is sneaking around trying to latch onto your party."
51,"I think it's fun to sprinkle in encounters/situations that reward players among the random battles. On my encounter table I like to put 3 or 4 simple cut scenes that can give the party or a single player a boost. The general idea here is that these are situations that are so damn wholesome that PC's can't help but feel inspired.

1.  (Night) The PC who takes the last watch observes the most beautiful sunrise they've ever seen. That PC gains inspiration.

2.   (Day) The party is caught up in a butterfly migration. For a solid hour they are continuously covered and then uncovered by hundreds of butterflies taking small rests on their long journey. The entire party gains inspiratoin.

3. (Day) The party comes upon a woman in labor in the back of a wagon along the road. If at least one member passes a DC 15 medicine check to help the woman, any character that can pass a DC 10 constitution check to watch the birth gains inspiration at the miracle of life.

4.  (Night) - While camped but before anyone is asleep, an elderly woman approaches the party and askes to share their fire. If they allow her she will produce some soft white puff balls and other food materials and proceed to make the party ""s'mextras"". Any PC who eats one gets inspiration.

5.  (Day) The party happens upon the conclusion of a small wedding ceremony and are asked to stay for the reception. If they do the entire party gains inspiration.

6. Walking through a city: a small child approaches the party, declares them all ""pretty"", and hands each a small wildflower. The entire party gains inspiration.  /Yuugian]

7. The party passes a puppet show: It is quite good and recognizably about one or more of the party's prior good deeds. The entire party gains inspiration /Yuugian]
Plavixo 3 points 5 hours ago 

8.  Walking through a forest, the party hear a plaintive bleating. They come across a baby deer stuck in the mud at the edge of a watering hole. Freeing the deer sees it scamper off. Later on, perhaps at sunset, the party see the deer herd, including baby deer, silhouetted dramatically on a ridge, and gain inspiration. /Plavixo]

9. Save a group of travelling artists on the road from random bandit attack, lead artist asks to sketch them. 1d4 days later in the next town they are in the party sees the act depicted in a mural in the town. /DuncanDisordely]

10. High perception check leads them to Forge Cleric stuck down a well, if they rescue them they bless them giving them advantage for their next weapon/spell attack. /DuncanDisordely]

11. (Day) They find an old garden, filled with flowers and apple trees and other forms of vegetation. It has a simple white shack inside laying in the center of it. If they enter the shack, they find a blackboard that says “May you please water the sunflowers?” With a simple white watering can next to it. If they do so, and return the watering can to the shack, the blackboard now says “Thank you kindly”, with a plate of newly made apple pie lying in front of it.  /hopeful_badger06]

12. (Night) They come across a diorama of what seems to be a castle sitting quietly by a small shrine. It’s very ramshackle and seems to have been made by a Tabaxi. It has a post-it note saying “For Papa, thank you for protecting us.” /hopeful_badger06]

13.  (Night) They find an old one-armed Triton living in an old sailboat that seems to have seen better days. He doesn’t mind that the boat’s on land, it reminds him of the adventures he had when he was younger. /hopeful_badger06]

14.  (Day) The players come across the Bun Brigade, a bunch of cats that wanders through the world and delivers exclusively bread! /hopeful_badger06]

15.  The PCs come across a story teller reciting an interesting story to a crowd. /World_of_Ideas ]

16.  The PCs come across a poetry recital. /World_of_Ideas ]

17.  The PCs come across a Festival. /World_of_Ideas ]

18.  The PCs come across a wandering chef, who wants to try out a new recipe and needs volunteers to taste test it. /World_of_Ideas ]

19.   Day - They come across a small group of goblins trying to act “civilized” and holding their own version of court because one of them was caught stealing.  /Puppies-B-Tasty]

20.  When the party comes back to their local tavern, everyone cheers and the tavern bard plays a hymn of their feats. They gain inspiration if they stay to hear it.  /paulinaiml]

21.  A little girl runs up as the party is passing by, entering the city. She has a single daisy who’s stem is getting a bit wilty, she holds it up to a party member, her big eyes wide with wonder. “It’s you! She said you would do great things!” And then she runs away.  /GMXIX]

22. After the party sits down in a pub they notice a guy sitting in the corner keeps checking one of them out over and over. He gets up and comes over and says, “aren’t you the guy who _____? Thank so so much!” He buys the party a round of drinks.   /GMXIX]

23. It’s closing time at the bakery. The baker offers the players pastries for little or nothing.   /GMXIX]

24.  The PCs encounter a group of children floating paper boats down a stream. One child is having difficulty, but will do much better with a little assistance. The attention and kindness of adventures lights up the eyes of the children. /onepostandbye]

25. An animal has caught its neck/antlers/paw in a tree’s crook. An easy Animal Handling check will allow a PC to calm the animal and free it. The animal pauses in thanks. It is a magnificent manifestation of nature’s beauty. /onepostandbye]

26. (Night) The stillness of the camp is disturbed by the arrival of a massive bird of prey. The noble animal seems content to share the light and warmth of the fire with the party. After a short time, the night is awakened by the distant scream of its mate, and the animal beats its wings once, and is gone. /onepostandbye]

27. (Night) A tiny trickle of a stream glows in the night, its pebbles covered with bioluminescent algae. In the dim light, an entire ecosystem of tiny animals can be seen going about their lives. Various woodland animals come to the stream to drink as the PCs take in the scene.  /onepostandbye]

28.  The PCs find an area of dimly colored lights. Upon approach, they discover tiny scintillating lights created by a group of pixies singing high overhead. Their dance causes tiny blooms of color to descend slowly to the ground. After the PCs or pixies depart, the PCs discover beautiful vivid patterns of color have come to rest upon themselves as well. /onepostandbye]

29.   They arrive at an inn shortly before a noble and their entourage arrive. The Noble has his men bring in 2 dead elk, sets them on the bar and tells the innkeeper to cook them. He then turns to one of the servants and gives them one gold piece to go inform the village of the meat so they call ALL partake! If they have some of the elk they gain 1 hp if they are wounded.  /Adventux]

30.   The party happens upon a ramshackled forge in the wilderness with a clanging coming from within. Inside, a large ogre sits with a burn-pit turned into a rough forge and a large boulder they are using as an anvil. They are hammering, with a warhammer, mish-mashed bunch of metal scraps and old armor pieces together into what appears to be a rough breastplate. They are weary of the party, but non-hostile as long as the party does not attack. The ogre knows broken common, but speaks ogre and goblin well enough. His dream is to one day become a mighty dwarven smith, and make legendary armor. However you wish to handle it, the party may get the idea to help them, whether it be by using their blacksmith tool proficiency to help teach them some basics, or giving them a legitimate set of blacksmith tools, or fixing up their hut or finding a way to improve their forge or supplies or even gifting them spare metal parts they are hauling around. They may also purchase ""Ruined Armor"" from them, which is awful by armor standards. However they chose to help, the ogre will be thrilled if the party does, and they will find a friend for the campaign. Depending on the level of assistance the party gives, the ogre might be seen later apprenticing in a small town, much to their amazement, or eventually making armor that could be considered ""basic"". If your players latch onto their journey, be sure to plan a short sidequest involving training with the Ogre to eventually ""try out"" at a dwarven forge to earn the right to apprentice under a dwarven smith, who is skeptical, but can be impressed by hard work and surprising proficiency if the ogre can achieve it.  /comedianmasta]

31.  A semi-recognized Bard of some renown is happened upon near town and is heading the same way as the party. He is an older man, but was an avid adventurer and tavern bard in his day before falling out of the public eye. If the party passes history (or performance checks for bards) the party might recall a few of his songs which are now staples amongst tavern bards. One is a jaunty party tune about a young man singing to a young lass about how he doesn't want to leave her, but life is calling and he has more living to do. If the party goes to the tavern with him, where he shall offer to buy first drinks, it is found they do not have a bard for the evening. Players can push them to play or not, getting free rooms for the whole party. If the bard sings, or doesn't, he will be recognized by a few tavern goers, who will request the song specifically. This time, when he sings it, although much of the words and tune are the same, the tempo is slower, and the meaning seems to change. An insight or wisdom check should reveal the song now takes on a new meaning, and can be seen as an older man saying goodbye to his dying wife. I truly wish I could write this song (happy and sad versions) to play at my table, but I feel like the twist on an old song could really be emotional. If the party asks, the story mirrors the song. The bard met a girl who changed everything, he stayed with her and lived their life, and ended up losing his wife to an illness he could not find a cure for. He now wanders aimlessly, half trying to discover a cure for his wife's sickness but also having long given up he awaits death on one last adventure.  

32.  The party happens upon a young paladin of vengeance stuck in the mud. If they assist him, he does not stay long, saying he is so close to avenging the death of his father. If the party tags along to help (or hinder) he might tell them of a great Half-Orc warrior who many years ago slew his father in battle. He has spent his entire life devoted to becoming strong enough to slay him. He builds this Half-Orc up as a vicious barbarian, with magic weapons and a fierce temper. He has secluded himself in a cabin for many years, and it has taken a long time to track them down. When they find the cabin [if you want, through some trials and puzzle or an encounter with the paladin] they will find it dark, cold, and seemingly abandoned. Breaking into the cabin will reveal it neglected, and the skeletal remains (or corpse) of a long-dead Half-Orc in a bed. He looks as if he has passed away a year or so ago, perhaps in his sleep. A magical Great Axe is hanging on a mantel not far away, a hand axe under the bed. Perhaps anything else you feel a barbarian warrior would've had as equipment stashed in a chest. Food is left rotted in a cooking pot in a cold fireplace. The paladin, robbed of his vengeance, goes into a rage and begin hacking and slashing and destroying the cabin, eventually breaking down into a sobbing mess. Their purpose is over, their oath fulfilled.... and they feel empty now that it is done. Depending on the actions of your party, they will either silently wish to head home, alone, and will continue traveling with the party until the next long rest, where they will take a watch before disappearing into the night as everyone sleeps. Or, if the party leaves them be after their tantrum, they will sink into a deep depression, and sit, catatonic, outside the cabin until the players leave. That night, in the distance back to the cabin, they might see a glow of a great fire, assumed to be the cabin being burned down.  /comedianmasta]

33.  At a carnival, the party might partake in some activities. One NPC catching eyes is a human child, in halfling or gnome armor, participating in the archery contest, jousting, and blunt sword fighting events. If pressed, the organizers will shrug and say ""There ain't nothing in the rules that says a child can't be a knight and participate and he paid the event fees."" If the party assists the child-knight with their armor, the child might request the party assist them with winning each of their events. If they do, win or lose, the child will offer them one favor to be called whenever the party is in trouble. ""Speak my name, and I will find you and help you."" Obviously this child is never going to find them and help them. But if you do time jumps in your campaign or anything, it would be HILARIOUS if this child grows up to become a fighter or paladin and can actually end up helping the party, cashing in said ""favor""/comedianmasta]

34.  The party comes across a small shrine to a deity they do not recognize. It has been damaged and dirtied by time, but it also appears someone has painted obscenities onto it and re-arranged (or broke) the statues. Either a small puzzle, or a series of relevant checks, can be made to attempt to repair and fix up the temple or simple clean it. If they do, the party gains the benefits of a long rest instantly and feels inspired. /comedianmasta]  
 
35.  After assisting the family in the small boat that is struggling to tie up to the dock, they invite you to their luxury yacht for drinks and tapas. /LucidFir]

I think about it from time to time and wanted to try it here.  For the first five, I'll put some of my playlists on shuffle and list the band, song and the idea it gave me.

1. Johnny Cash - A Singer Of Songs: The party meets a bard NPC whose song lyrics  divulge clues about the campaign.

2. Napalm Death - The Chains That Bind Us: If captured by an enemy, the PC will be chained to a wall.  There is poison on the metal that causes 1 D4 of damage per round when in them.

3. The Spinners - The Rubberband Man: The party meets an NPC wearing rubber-like armor that isn't very tactical but allows him to bounce kind of high.

4. Eddie Rabbit - I Love A Rainy Night: A druid knight wearing a rabbit headdress has advantage in combat during inclement weather.

5. Modest Mouse - Float On: The party must infiltrate a castle surrounded by water by floating stealthily by guards and avoiding traps.

I'm interested to see what other people come up with."
56,"I plan to have some PCs meet in prison and break out, but I need to know the ridiculous reasons why, allegedly, they landed in jail. Please begin them all with ""Allegedly,"" as they are all appealing.

1. Allegedly, it's a crime to be an ethical bank robber for a living. I swear I was going to do a full write up about their security vulnerabilities!

2. Allegedly, collecting wild creatures as pets is a crime? I mean, honestly, a few owlbears get loose, and suddenly I'm a criminal?

3. Allegedly, someone burned a threatening message in the lawn in front of my ex-lover's new fling's house, and everyone comes looking for me because I said a few things when I was a little drunk?

4. Allegedly, streaking through town every night yelling foul invitations to the public rises to a jailable offense when you do it for a few months straight.. where's that written?

5. Allegedly, I punched the son of a duke at the bar, but, seriously, who can tell, we were both super drunk, right?

6. Allegedly, I temporarily turned a local lord into a cat. (U/dilxoxoxlib)

7. Allegedly, I sold a cake to the local ruler but it was not to their tastes. (U/Jejmaze)

8. Allegedly I was selling fake dungeon maps to adventuring parties. They were supposed to tell me if they found and removed the treasure. When I didn’t hear from them I assumed they didn’t make it out alive and that it was therefore okay to send another party there.(U/MyEvilTwin47)

9. Allegedly the ale I served the mayor didn’t just smell and taste like owl bear piss. (U/MyEvilTwin47

10. Allegedly walking around town with a grappling hook, wearing all black and carrying around a bag of jewelry on the same night the Queen’s bedchamber was robbed is considered suspicious behavior. (U/MyEvilTwin47

11. “Allegedly, you should mind your own fuckin’ business!” *attempts to headbutt you through prison bars* (U/A_Very_Lonely_Waffle)

12. Allegedly,  I handed the arresting Paladin a bag of gold in order to look the other way and apparently that's ""flagrant bribery""! I mean, her underlings didn't seem to have a problem with that earlier on. (U/MutatedMutton)

13. Allegedly , I was running an unethical Gnome Breeding and Smuggling mill. I'm just saying, there are many nobles willing to pay top dollar for a cute Gnome retainer, especially if they have a debilitating but aesthetic genetic condition. (U/MutatedMutton)

14. Apparently, my idea to help people find love at the cost of a modest fee was a crime! Stupid anti-pimping laws (U/MutatedMutton)

15. Allegedly, I farted in the presence of a duchess. She can deny it all she wants, she started it! I was just showing her how to REALLY do it. (U/MutatedMutton)

16. Allegedly, I was caught casting spells that were banned by the Wizard Convention. Dang, I was really curious to see what the Effervescent Organ spell woulda done. (U/MutatedMutton)

19. Allegedly, I cast Cloud Kill on a group of enemy soldiers and some people considered that a war crime. (U/AccidentalFireball)

21. Allegedly, I am the main suspect in baked goods robbery. Turns out it was a sting operation and the pies were laced with laxatives. They are keeping me here to see how long until I have to go poop. (U/IchthysLovesYou)

22. Allegedly, the mayor's pet bear was kidnapped by me. They say they have proof but I'm not telling them anything. Besides, where am I supposed to hide a bear? (U/IchthysLovesYou)

23. Allegedly, I committed the crime of ""illegal summoning of a circus performer while running for elected office"". I think that is a niche and archaic law that no one could have expected. Plus, a mime is NOT a circus performer. (U/IchthysLovesYou)

24. Allegedly, the kobold died of a shellfish allegery from food I made him. I never technically gave the food to him, I left it on his table. Is it my fault he ate it so quickly? No!

25. Allegedly, I gave the new city guard a ""happy birthday bootlicker"" cake with a bomb inside. And hey, even if I did he still enjoyed it! There's no cake left! (U/IchthysLovesYou)

30. Allegedly, there was a murder and I allegedly had the murder weapon on my person with blood stains. Little do they know I'm a butcher and I just got off work! (U/NecessaryCornflake7)

31. Allegedly, I had a forbidden relationship with the princess and was found in her quarters in the middle of the night. She was out of town and I was catching up on my cleaning duties! Hmph! (U/NecessaryCornflake7)

32. Allegedly, I look exactly like a criminal they have been hunting for years: face, haircut, and all. Just my luck (U/NecessaryCornflake7)

43. Allegedly, I sold a mimic to someone disguised as a sex toy. (U/Kami-Kahzy)

44. Allegedly, I was wearing Red in a Green district on a Blue Day.  That duke really needs to lay off the spice... (U/Adventux)

45. Allegedly, I tried to steal an election and gaslighted a bunch of respectable people into supporting me. To make matters worse, did you know our rulers aren't even elected??? Birthright?  Really???

46. Allegedly I've absconded with a cart full of tomatoes to sell to unsuspecting villagers. The fact that my trousers have red stains all over has nothing to do with it.(U/TexMex42)

47. Allegedly I went to a tavern only filled with regulars and as a healthy man died while I was there I'm the killer. They don't even know me !!! (U/TexMex42)

49. Allegedly, *someone* kidnapped and ate the duke's grown-ass son. Allegedly, Someone got drunk at a bar and bragged about it saying, ""They could eat a whole man in a sitting"" and allegedly the proof was ""in a coil moving slowly for the pot"" and ""wanna find the duke's son, wait a few hours""  ...so, here we are. (U/Bogsy_)

50. Allegedly, a man matching my description was seen painting that *horrific* graffiti on the church. I've never even picked up a paintbrush in my life, and I was sound asleep at the time, but I guess those crazy zealots just wanted *someone* to throw in jail. (U/bhelhop)

51. Allegedly, you incorrectly entered the Konami code. Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A Start. (U/ButtonholePhotophile)

55. Allegedly teaching the goblins outside of town tactics and strategy in exchange for a cut of the increased profits from their raids is illegal. (U/ksgt69)

56. Allegedly taking a horse for a three month test drive is illegal. (U/ksgt69)

57. Allegedly, I murdered the mayor's pet cow. Beyond a reasonable doubt, though, it was great with ketchup!

59. Allegedly, I look just like the person that had purchased a programmable Magic Mouth stone that was used to broadcast, perfectly understandably to all and with a very strong signal, the intimate and financial details of my two-faced, tool-stealing, late-night-partying neighbor. Somehow, doing this at any time, let alone 2am, is some sort of crime.

60. Allegedly, I tied my enemy to the big hand of the village clock, where, at 3:15 on the dot, those hands would come together to crush my enemy like an insect, if not for the intervention of a certain vigilante. But I did nothing of the such! It's mistaken identity. I'm just a civic-minded citizen with a lot of time on his hands.

61. Allegedly, a man who is in a loving committed relationship with a Bugbear is guilty of, ""Gross violations of the lawful order of natural relations"", but I ask you who are we to criminalize true love? (U/average_texas_guy)

62. Allegedly, sneaking around in a cemetery after dark and raising the dead counts as defiling a corpse. (U/kandoras)

68. Allegedly, the local Duke didn't appreciate my ""The Aristocrats"" joke (U/zenerift)

70. Allegedly, selling ""Moon-Touched Swords"" that aren't magical is false advertising! Well, I certainly left them out at night, can't get more moon touched than that! (U/zenerift)

71. Allegedly, I was spying on my neighbor through my rather smart trained blackbird and stealing his secrets, my neighbor being the brother of the royal financial advisor.

72. Allegedly, it's a crime to make yourself somewhat resemble the duke and then not bother to correct every fool who thinks you are him. Am I supposed to send out a messenger every time I practice appearance spells?! (U/qo33a)

73. Allegedly, it's still a crime to kill your neighbour's pig even if it ate more of your crops than it itself is worth. All I did was punish a thief in proportion, how is that not justice? (U/qo33a)

74. Allegedly, it's ""blasphemous"" to perform a swinging jazz cover of a religious hymn. Some people just don't appreciate artistic experimentation. (U/qo33a)

75. Allegedly I was caught taking a bath in the fountain of the center square. If it wasn't made for bathing, then why does it look like a bathtub? (U/vboy315)

78. Allegedly, it's ""against the law"" to get rid of cursed magic items by giving them to babies. (U/ATtheorytime)

79. Allegedly, I was involved in the angering of a volcano.  White hot gases and ash exploded high into the heavens, while fast-moving currents of hot gas and volcanic matter skittered away from the volcano at incredible speeds. For 4 unlucky cities, you either were burned to death by flaming ash or encased in sizzling liquefied rock. It was awesome... Err... Awful, and I was never there. Although, I've heard it being called the greatest eruption in history!

80. Allegedly, a miracle liquid metal healing potion I sold a rich merchant, for quite a discount even, caused him blurry vision, memory loss, unsteadiness, and seizures? Or, and I'm just throwing this out there, karma dealt him some evil demons in the head and he is due a bit of trepany?

81. Allegedly, selling nine square wheels to a diminished-capacity octogenarian on a bicycle is one step too far and violates some sort of elder abuse law?  What???

82. Allegedly, I jumped off a tall cliff with a securely fastened outstretched linen to glide my way into a neighboring enemy dukedom's royal palace and caused some sort of inter-dukedom incident? Breach of treaty or some such?

83. Allegedly, I killed my brother's father-in-law when I jumped out of a cake at his *second* coming of age party. The guy was pretty old, so how is everyone so sure I scared him to death? Right? He might have just croaked because there was a stiff wind for all I know.

84. Allegedly, I threw up in the sacred pond.  Okay, I'll admit it was a possibility, we were all pretty drunk at that party, but I can clearly remember two other guys throwing up in that pond.  Hells, I remember a guy actually taking a leak in it.  But did they get arrested?  Noooooo!  (A/Moon_Dew)
  
85. Allegedly, I ""impersonated the court jester"" and, again, allegedly, ""assaulted the court jester with weaponized seafood"".  Just because I was wearing the same costume doesn't mean I'm impersonating someone, and slapping someone across the face with a fish is a classic slapstick gag!  I swear, the royal family has no sense of humor. (A/Moon_Dew)

86. Allegedly, I sold a legendary ""bicorn"" to a noble, its really just a fat rhino. (A/AwkwardTRexHug)"

Let’s try more interesting ideas!

Name:  
Size:  
Owner:  
Patrons:  
Fun Fact:  

1. **The Hole**- this dilapidated, rickety wood shanty is barely ten feet square. There are no chairs inside, only a log against one wall. A single torch near the door gives off dim light. Two dwarves are asleep on the floor. The “bartender” is an Orc called Urk. He sits on a stool with a single barrel of what he calls ale. He dips a tin cup into it and hands it to you, saying “two copper”. Any half empty cups get dumped back into the barrel. The place smells of boiled cabbage. Urk is really an undercover member of the City Guard, and tells them of any nefarious rumors he learns.

2. **The House of the Lonesome Unicorn**
A PRIVATE ESTABLISHMENT
(*membership, available through the large human male at the door, allows immediate entrance and only cost 100gp per person*)
Carved logs and engraved marble pillars make up most of the building's outer structure. It's a large building, two stories, and about 80 feet square. Fancy thick curtains cover the tall stained-glass windows, and upbeat music spills out into the street. Polished, wooden beams support the upper floor and the ambient lights (*oil lanterns*)  suspended from them. The walls are plastered with flags of all sorts and sizes. Some are from nearby towns or provinces, others from the far corners of the world, all apparently posted by patrons. Round tables are surrounded by high-backed chairs, and young male elves dressed in immaculately pressed and starched crisp white tunics move from table to table pouring expensive red wines into tall crystal goblets. The center of the room is a dance floor where a string quartet plays a lively waltz. The owner, a wealthy middle aged Human female named Windswept, sits at a corner table with obvious Aristocrats and their Sorcerous bodyguards. In fact, you now notice there is a guardsman seated at each of the tables, and standing near the curved mahogany staircase leading to the second floor bedchambers.

3. **Flooney’s Seven Table Public House** - a 40ft by 80ft L-shaped building with wide opened shutters allowing in plenty of fresh air. The owner *Flooney* is a male Halfling who grew up right here in town, and never left. His grandfather started the seven table tavern nearly a century ago, and his father ran it after that. He expects his son to one day take over. The walls are a whitewashed knotty pine, as are the tables. Each chair has a pillow tacked to the seat and no two pillows are alike. There are a dozen locals present, mainly humans and a lone half-elf, taking up four of the tables, and the aroma of lavender fills the room. Lodging is available in a free common room- a courtesy for inebriated customers. A potbelly coal stove just inside the door keeps the room warm. The place is well known for a hundred miles as having the best mulberry pie throughout the summer."

Seriously please do it, it makes it a lot easier to see what has already been suggested. [Here is an example](
62,"1. The tavern was built on the ruins of an old pub that burned down. According to the legend, the fire started because of a curse that a witch put on it.
2.  The Smashed Lute got its name after the owner made very clear his opinions on bards who think they should get free shit if they play some music.  (by)
3. 3. The owner claims that both it and himself were somehow teleported here from a different dimension and that his inventory is re-stocked by the same strange magic. Even with his unusual clothes(i.e a modern tuxedo) and very strange beverages(cocktails and liqueurs from an upscale New York nightclub) you're sure it's just a marketing gimmick. (by
4. The Admiral's Lover is built out of a large, beached ship. The first owner was a sailor who wanted to spend more time on land with their partner but didn't want to leave their ship behind. (by)"
63,"This whole thread is gold. 

1. Bear Trap. When activated, summons 1d20 enraged bears.

2. ""Treasure Vault"" upon opening this door you must make reflex save vs being vaulted into a large pile of fake gold coins. (sorta version of )

3. A small doggie door carved with the words ""Spike Trap."" Beyond it is a hungry, trained attack dog with a name tag that reads, ""Spike.""

4. Variant: falling floor trap. The floor of the level above falls onto you.

5. ""10 foot trap"", 10 metal feet pop out of the walls and attempt to crush them into the wall.

6. Maybe have a trap/puzzle (the Chronographer's Dilemma or whatever) that's supposed to be solved by one of the PCs wearing a belt made of clocks, but it doesn't work.... (It's just a waist of time.)

7. Warning! Frightful Presence Ahead: Players expect a Dragon or something with Frightful Presence, only to find a pile of wrapped gifts. Naturally, opening one releases something scary and the PCs have to make a save against fear effects. Bonus points if a Dragon comes in and scolds the PCs for opening its birthday presents.

8. Dart Trap: Must win a game of darts to pass.

9. Honey Trap: Literally just a giant pit of extra sticky honey. (Bees optional, giant or otherwise.) If a PC gets trapped, an illusion of a sexy member of their race comes in to point and laugh.

10. ""You walk through the door, but suddenly IT'S A TEN-STORY DROP!"" -""I grab for the frame to catch myself before I fall!"" - ""What fall? Ten storybooks drop from the ceiling and land on your head. Take 1d10 damage.""

11. One area is filled with shallow sea water. If they look around, they will find several submerged watertight boxes made of weak wood. One is labeled ""for assault and battery"". If they choose to smash it open, they find that there is an electrical device inside, and everyone gets electrocuted (by a salted battery).

12. The ground of one area is rough, like a cheese grater. There is a large door with the warning 'beware of dragon'. If a player grabs onto the doorknob he gets stuck to it. The doorknob becomes animated and starts draggin' the player across the rough floor, causing severe scrapes all over the body.

13. When the players enter a room, you tell them that there is a bone chest there. When they try and open it, they get attacked by the skeleton (whose chest you were referring to earlier).

14. A room full of exploding bras. A literal booby trap.

15. Party must walk through an herb garden to get where they need to go. Most herbs are safe, but stepping on the thyme will trigger a spike trap. Because thyme wounds all heels. - or maybe it just casts timestop cos it's a lich garden, maybe the garden is full of lychee and that's the clue...

16. A priceless work of art stashed in the eyesocket of a statue of a Beholder. (You know, beauty is in the eye of the beholder and all...)

17. Poison-dart trap on the back of a vegetation-covered gnoll. (Shooter on the grassy knoll)

18. This is more of a puzzle than a trap: ""You come to across a fork in the hallway, a path goes left and right""
Regardless of which path they take, they always come back to the fork. The solution is to pick up the fork, and the hallway continues straight!

19. The players are stuck in a row boat with 3 matches in it. There is a sign that says ""you need a match lighter. The players must toss a match overboard so the whole boat becomes ""one match lighter""

20. ""There WILL be a murder in the next room"" The room is full of cages of all types of animals and a statue with a scythe. The party must release several crows so that's the ""murder"" and none of the players get murdered by the statue.

21. The quest giver says ""find me in an ice house"" The players will probably hear ""a nice house"" when it's really ""an ice house""

22. Speed trap: a hidden guard reveals themselves with a magical device that tracks speed, the guard will write up a ticket and warn the party to watch their speed and travel safe.

23. Booby Trap: An important looking statue sits at the feet of a statue of a woman. A sign on the statue warns that it can only be opened by a woman. The box is locked and there is no key. If you succeed in opening the locked box, there is a puff of pinkish-purple smoke and the character finds themselves looking like the well endowed feminine statue holding the warning.

24. Snake Pit: The party fight their way through a swarm of venomous snakes to find a fruit tree whose trunk looks like several smaller trees woven together. The tree shakes violently at their approach, flinging large fruits everywhere. These fruits break open on the next turn, releasing snakes from where their seeds should be.

25. Shock Trap: The party notice their vision is a little hazy as they enter a corridor. There was a warning about testing their metal. They are suddenly assaulted by illusions of all sorts of frightening and horrifying things and must succeed CON saves or be Frightened by the shocking images.

26. Rat Trap: The party finds themselves in a labyrinth after attempting to aid an old lady with her ‘rat problem’. They will likely end up being pursued around the twists and turns by a gigantic rat that can barely fit round some of the tight corners.

27. Log trap: The party hear a whoosh as a log suspended over head whizzes a foot over their heads… before the floor drops out from under them and the log drops into the pit after them.

28. Tourist trap: An impressive looking monument has appeared near a fairly large town, but there are rumours of people going missing since it’s arrival. Turns out the monument hides a darker purpose, and captures any lone travellers who get too close for a Lich who lives below.

29. Glue trap: The party finds a room that appears to be entirely upside down. Interacting with any object on the ‘floor’ (chairs, tables, etc) reveals them to be Mimics covered in a sticky coating that immediately grapples the target without a save. Now the pack of Mimics come to life, leaving the party to fight gooey furniture monsters.

30. Mousetrap: The party finds themselves at the beginning of some kind of obstacle course with a variety of traps, gaps and challenges to get through. They also notice that a Rube Goldberg contraption has started a timer, and a giant cage will fall over their exit of they’re not fast enough!

31. Trapjacks: The route forward is covered in strange, colourfully painted boxes. Approaching one causes it to play a childish melody, getting faster the closer you get. If you pass within 5 ft of one or end your turn within 10 ft, it rapidly plays the full melody of ‘Pop goes the Weasel’ before spraying caltrops within a 30 ft radius and revealing a clockwork clown on a spring (a Jack in the Box) that begins hurling darts at the closest target within 120 ft until the players escape the room/corridor.

32. Shut yer Trap!: While moving through a forest, one player triggers an invisible bear trap. As they take damage and cry out in pain, they realise they cannot speak or make any noise at all. Even the sound of the trap being set off was muted by a Silence spell. They better hope their allies notice they’re in danger, as the trap restrains them until they are released or can pass a STR check to open/reset the trap. They might notice a couple of other victims (or at least their remains) on their route.

33. Honey trap: The party must pass through a room filled with lustful men and women all engaging in… amorous activities. They’ll quickly realise it’s an illusion… mostly an illusion anyway. Once they realise it’s not real, they’ll discover the sucubus/incubus hiding amongst the illusions who, once spotted, will attack. (Works just as well at a rich nobles party when the distractions are real people who will run out screaming once the demons are discovered).

34. Clap trap: After a circus passed through town, several people went missing. While investigating, the party will have to be careful not to avoid the same fate, and be charmed to join the audience permanently, constantly giving round after round of applause to the same acts over and over again.

35. Fireball trap : The players are doused in a quantity of cinnamon scented liquor equivalent to force a reflex save or be knocked prone.

36. Rock trap : Suddenly all around them loud music plays. Players standing within 50ft should roll fortitude and then 3d6 sonic damage, with a passed save halving it. Deaf characters are not affected.

37. (A)net(te) trap: The image of a beautiful woman appears before the players and begins to talk. Players standing within 20ft must make a will save or be stunned for three rounds. As long as the woman keeps talking then the players must make a new roll every turn if they're not already stunned. Can be dispelled as though cast as a major illusion. Deaf or blind characters are affected though have an advantage to their DC. Deaf and blind characters are wholly unaffected.

38. A group of constructs begins some sort of crazy dance where they smash everything near them. ""break dancing""

39. Sticky red cloth shoots out and wraps around the victim, entangling them. They have been caught up in ""red Tape""

40. Herding cats trap: 1d10 cats spawn and you must gather them all up to continue

41. Drama Queen: Hit this trap will spawn an argumentative teenager that will disagree with everything you say, convincing them to take your side or giving them something they want will turn the tide for you

42. Stuffed Mimic: It looks like a normal chest, on closer inspection it resembles a mimic but its just a large stuffed and comfortable chair. The top of the chest that flip back acts as the back rest for the chair

43. A Tea Fling: A tiefling tosses a teapot at you.

44. A weapon trap with a spiky ball on the end of a chain that, no matter how the players are near it or hit by it as it swings will always have an attack-roll of 1, a critical flail.

45. Parent Trap: As soon as you set it your parents show up out of nowhere. Your mom goes on and on about how happy she is to see you having fun with your friends, while your dad shakes his head and repeats “This’ll never pay the bills, you need to get a real job”. u_rustmonster

12. Attuning Fork(A tuning Fork): (requires attunement) Hitting this fork against an item that requires attunement causes the Attuning Fork to instantly unattune and the hit item to attune to you. If you attempt this on an item that is already attuned to someone, you must first hit the item with an attack roll then make contested charisma checks. If you win the check the item attunes to you instead. If used on a cursed item, that prevents unattunement the Attuning fork instead lets out a piercing note and becomes unusable for 1d4 days. /cybermage99](

73,"# Living Steel and Stone

Warforged are formed from a blend of organic and inorganic materials. Root-like cords infused with alchemical fluids serve as their muscles, wrapped around a framework of steel, darkwood, or stone. Armored plates form a protective outer shell and reinforce joints. Warforged share a common facial design, with a hinged jaw and crystal eyes embedded beneath a reinforced brow ridge. Beyond these common elements of warforged design, ***the precise materials and build of a warforged vary based on the purpose for which it was designed***.

\^ From Eberron: Rising from the Last War regarding Warforged

What are some designs you think might be unique for warforged?

1. Shadow: A sleek, darkwood framed warforged wearing black dyed studded leather armor. A rogue designed for assassination and information-gathering missions carried out in the gloom of night.
2. Cannon: A warforged of middling build, reinforced with lead, Cannon wears a cloak to disguise themselves on the battlefield. Traveling in a specialized squad, Cannon's troop targets enemies wielding magical items on the battlefield, where after the warforged quickly *identifies* the acquired items and turns them against enemy forces around them.
3. Medic: A warforged constructed from white pine reinforced with steel, a corundum cross decorates Medic's chest. Medic responds eagerly to injured comrades (and maybe enemies?) alike on the battlefield, applying their healer's kit for lesser injuries and providing magical healing or *potions of healing* for more serious cases.
4. Ballista: A warforged specialized in ranged combat, Ballista is constructed from malachite and wood, with twin hand crossbows attuned to each of their arms (functioning as the *armblade* magical item does).
5. Guts: A warforged constructed from corundum with gold embellishment and sapphire eyes, Guts specializes in hand-to-hand combat. Bounding into the battlefield, Guts' punches push his opponents back to clear space for reinforcements.
6. Librarian: Warforged model designed with information gathering and preservation in mind. Provided additional plating for head protection, serving as a type of black box. Model used for battlefield analysis and tactical support as well as relaying information. \[/Wikilast\]
7. Kamikaze: Fast, lightly armored, and cheap. Filled with an explosive mixture of compounds. \[/Wikilast\]
8. Dragon: Made with infernal steel coating, this unit is extremely resistant to high temperatures internally generated by their arcane core, which allows them to create various flamethrower-like effects. They generate a lot of steam. Grate for trench-clearing and destroying fortifications. \[/Wikilast\]
9. Mjölnir: Warforged crafted with mithril-star metal alloy fitted with runes. This design allowed for extremely efficient electrical discharges to be produced by the model. Used in communication sabotage and directed war machine disabling missions. \[/Wikilast\]
10. K9: Warforged made with plasteel alloy, with an ability to re-configurate its anatomy to a suitable shape and size allowing for mimicry of various bioforms. \[/Wikilast\]
11. Smasher: A Jason Momoa-style frame made out of adamantine and mithril, it has tetrigrade legs and quad-petaled feet, it's left forearm ends in a bident that can retract, it's right hand is an over sized 5 digit hand with a heavily armored forearm and retractable claws, it comes equipped with half-plate. Smasher is designed to infiltrate a fortification during battle and knock down some extra holes in the walls. \[/USSChucklefucker\]
12. Gnasher: A slim but powerfully built warforged who was crafted of fine dark-iron wood and reinforced with blackened mithril, it has an oversized lupine jaw filled adamantine teeth and instead of humanoid feet, it has feet shaped similarly to the hybrid form of Were creatures, and it has clawed hands to match. This Warforged was designed to terrorize an occupying army with no need for food, reinforcement or even gear not provided in nature, after their wilderness and urban survival training were complete. \[/USSChucklefucker\]
13. Slasher: A short but broad and thick warforged comprised of pure blackened mithril that has *boots of springing and striding* and *adamantine-mithril* full plate fully built in, as with two *armblades* on each arm; fully unable to remove any of his gear, creating difficult wounds to handle without healing magic. They do not speak and only physically nods or shakes their head or writes down responses due to his speech modulator being disabled during the extensive augmentation they underwent. Slasher is perfectly designed for hit and run assassination. \[/USSChucklefucker\]
14. Basher: A large and beefy looking warforged comprised of dwarven adamantine, elven spring steel, and human crafted mithril, she is roughly the same size and shape of a smaller than average **barlgura**, leading to her having fists so large they easily shatter fortifications and clumped together groups by sheer force. She prefers cooking the meals for the team she leads because she feels it helps her connect with them more, even though her intense desire to protect members of her team leads to her needing numerous limbs replacements; everyone under her command treats her with the same love as a sibling. \[/USSChucklefucker\]
15. Dasher: A slim and short warforged, made mostly of elven spring steel and druidic ironwood, whose legs are the hind haunches of an Arabian Andalusia, and the arms of a Great Ape, leading to them being able to create a sprinting lope that propels at such a quick rate that regardless of whether Dasher is hurtling towards a tactical officer to deliver crucial information regarding enemy formations or weak points, or whether they're sprinting in circles around their enemy as they carve beautiful spirals in their opponents flesh. \[/USSChucklefucker\]
16. Shield Wall: A large warforged constructed from high grade steel alloys. It carries an extra large tower shield in addition to any other armaments. On its back are multiple quivers of ammo for archers or ballista warforged, that follow behind it. \[/World_of_Ideas\]
17. Inferno: A light warforged wearing fire-retardant clothes over heat-shielding metals and a steel frame, Infernos are equipped with flame jets which are meant for enemy crowd control and skirmishing, Geneva Conventions be damned. \[/Your_InsideMan\]
18. Smashy: Armor replaced with adamantine covered in 6"" spikes. An unfortunate case of amnesia after falling off a cliff and then raised by a group of oddly friendly **goblins**. Enjoys giving out hugs. Yes the hugs are usually lethal and yes he is sad every time. \[/Remembers_that_time\]
19. Reavers: Warforged made from shendo vines and reinforced with a strange, mercurial alloy which is pliable to the touch and solid to blunt force. Shendo vines ravage forests, acting as parasites to native trees. Reavers can pluck limbs from the bodies of fallen warforged, their bodies integrating with them long enough to take advantage of the fallen's specialty or to discharge its remaining life force in a single strike strong enough to destroy the limb. \[/asterisk_dot_jpg\]
20. AED: Based on a tempest cleric build, with a quartz core with electrum lines going to parts of the body that are exposed, it uses its electrical field to resuscitate fallen allies or to fell its foes. The electrum would require upkeep, and so AED would need to find sources to replenish the broken or worn wiring or contact pads. Is there one, or a series of AED warforged? YOU decide! \[/timacx\]
21. Sentinel: An entirely uncut stone golem of sorts, designed to be able to pass as a large boulder when in the fetal position. Ultimately designed to reveal themselves behind enemies and draw attention away from squishier combatants and take hits, all the while punishing those who ignore them with large stone mauls. Works best (in my mind) as a battlemaster fighter. \[/Megakello\]
22. Skirmisher: A lightweight warforged made entirely of wood and leaves, designed to blend in within the leafy boughs of trees in a forest. Perfect for jumping between branches and sneaking up on unsuspecting targets, firing crossbows as fast as possible and being almost impossible to keep an eye on for long. I imagine them being either an assassin or scout rogue. \[/Megakello\]
23. Overwatch: A middling sized warforged constructed from corundum and gold, Overwatch was designed with wings providing them a flight speed equal to their walking speed. Equipped with *eyes of the eagle*, and with *telepathic bond* or *telepathy* cast upon them, Overwatch takes to the skies to take aerial surveillance of the battlefield, whilst directing troop movements telepathically.

75,"Hello, I play a world where the Far Realm is an alternative version of the world like Feywild and Shadowfell. The Far Realm is then a pale imitation of the Material Plane where everything is distorted, alien and nothing makes sense. Portals can spawning in the Material Plane if too much aberrant energy accumulates at a certain point (sometimes the corpse of a spectator is enough...).

To better develop this world and its strangeness, I am looking for strongly magical and very powerful entities (the equivalent of Elder Evils in terms of roles). In my campaign, an ""Elder Evil"" appears by itself where there is a sun in the Material Plane. So there is at least one super-powerful entity per star system. Moreover, their very presence defines what the surroundings in the Far Realm will consist of. I will need help to imagine these entities.

To help me, I plan to make two lists, one of names and one of prefixes, like most of the Elder Evils (for this reason, this generator also works for Elder Evils).

&#x200B;"
76,"You find yourself needing to accomplish a certain task - probably *go* there, *do* something, and then *come back here* - within a certain amount of time. Let's find out why!

For simplicity's sake, assume the time limit is always from days upwards - at least a week. No time limits in hours or ""do this in 3 days"" because that doesn't make for very interesting choices.

Every prompt must include what happens if you fail the time attack.

1. Someone doesn't have a lot of time left on this earth, either because of wounds or age, and this needs to be done before they pass. Alternatively, the mission is directly tied to their health somehow, and needs to be accomplished if they're to live.

2. You made a bet or an oath that this would be done in such time. There's something at stake.

3. Something will blow up if the time runs out, and the task relates to that.

4. You're racing someone on a grand scale. If the timer runs out, they arrived first.

5. Someone told you they'd wait a determinate amount of time for this task to be fulfilled, before they move on and forget whatever promise they made to you.

6. You're running away from something much faster - or from a big organisation. If you don't arrive at your destination in time, the thing has catched up to you.

7. There's a city under siege, and if the task isn't done in time, people will starve.

8. Somebody else will introduce their own solution to the problem at that point - a much nastier solution. [/gnurdette]

9. The MacGuffin you need to solve the problem will run out of charge/enchantment. [/gnurdette]

10. A specific calendar date is the only one available to solve the problem: it has to be done on a holiday festival, or on a date of religious significance, or whatnot. [/gnurdette]

11. The boss will be coming to ask about your progress. [/gnurdette]

12. It's an important mission, but you're still not going to miss your wedding anniversary / Mom's birthday / etc. for it. [/gnurdette]

13. The enemy will soon be receiving reinforcements that will make success impossible. [/gnurdette]

14. A different threat will be arriving and you'll need to be free to deal with that. [/gnurdette]

15. An impatient ally will withdraw their offer of help if you don't act fast enough. [/gnurdette]

16. Astrology dictates that success is only possible within a specific time window; after that, fate will turn against you. [/gnurdette]

17. The ship that will carry you to safety will only wait so long; if it leaves without you, you'll be stranded with the vengeful enemy. [/gnurdette]

18. An unusual plague is beginning to spread and food/medical supplies need to be delivered. Desperate refugees, survivors, and infected peoples are raiding caravans, and almost no one wants to be near the plague areas, so it's up to the party to deliver. (Or, they need to defeat the sorcerer who is causing it) [/WestwardNorthWindow]

19. War is beginning to boil between two kingdoms/nations that is based on false information for both sides, and the party has evidence to prevent it. [/WestwardNorthWindow]

20. A shadow organization is planning on assassinating a beloved king and the party has come upon the plans. [/WestwardNorthWindow]

21. The mob boss the party made a deal with to get information wants their cut by this date. [/WestwardNorthWindow]

22. Classic Evil outsider rift is opening and more baddies spill out every day the McGufffin isn't achieved [/Bullrawg]

23. A powerful inevitable has given them x amount of time to complete a task and if not completed it will begin to pursue the goal on its own with 0 regard for collateral damage on the material plane [/Bullrawg]

24. It's the last wish of a dying loved one party wants to make that wish come true before they expire, but you need an npc the whole party likes and be willing to kill them [/Bullrawg]

25. It's a court order as consequences for damages the last time the party ""saved the day"" do it or face jail time, sentence carries expected deadlines [/Bullrawg]

26. There's no time limit but if finished before x day they receive a bonus in pay [/gfs696]

27. The MacGuffin is alchemical, unstable, and must be delivered before it explodes. [/onepostandbye]

28. The MacGuffin is culinary, and must be delivered before it is ruined. [/onepostandbye]

29. The MacGuffin is hatching, and must be delivered before it imprints on something other than it’s mother. [/onepostandbye]

30. The quest giver is a powerful ally that will withdraw support and resources from the party if they fail to deliver on time. [/onepostandbye]

31. The mission lends support to a great lie that will be otherwise be soon exposed. [/onepostandbye]

32. The quest giver is extraordinarily fickle. While they currently love the party, they will hunt them down with malice if they do not meet the time expectations established at the outset. [/onepostandbye]

33. A military operation is about to begin, and the party must obtain critical intelligence that shows that the general’s plans are flawed. [/onepostandbye]

88,"100 unique hunters having the “I live to hunt” conviction. It could be anything. Assassins, monsters, demons, even things. It could be a solitary hunter, a couple or a group. 

You can describe them with physical traits, hunting methods, preferences on prey, origin (their history), their motives etc.

1. A centaur from the beastlands’ realm of the planescape multiverse. Hunts down powerful, massive creatures of the wild, by forcing them  into flight and killing them while on the run. He enjoys the rush during the open spree.

2. A half-blood Yuan-ti. It finds great pride and fulfillment in tracking down and killing the rarest and most elusive creatures in all realms. It uses a lot of illusion magic.

3. Timotheus Tul, a vampire duke who indulges himself  in solitary escapades to hunt down the most intelligent beings, for fun.

4.  A saber-tooth, large, six legged beast, with a fur of ever changing colors. Its sense of smell is unmatched. An Apex predator with high intelligence. The origins of this creature are unknown. Only speculations and legends exist,  claiming that it was  either a mad man’s experiment or a wave of disruptive cosmic rays that gifted that creature with that acute intelligence and its ability to camouflage. 

5. The spider mechanus: a huge construct, originally created as a retriever during an ancient war, it’s been mindlessly roaming  the hidden corners of this world, hunting, killing, without anybody to control it, for all its masters are long gone, centuries past.

6. A wemic hunter that leads her own band of fellow wemics, that will slaughter anything they can find, bringing back large hauls of meat to their pride

7. They're a hunter, who hunts a member of the party for whatever reason (in mine it's cause he's a shifter) and won't stop until they're dead, even going for killing blows if need be (talk with the members to see if they're okay with it!!)

8. An old, blind man dressed in dark victorian garb who insists on hunting werewolves since he views them as a plague. He has an immaculate sense of smell and is violent towards those he does not view as werewolf hunters, but despite the fact he is so intent on hunting them down he himself is a werewolf. 

9. A bullywug hunter who specializes in hunting giant insects. He also knows a dozen different recipes for cooking them.

10. A sahaugin who hunts orcas to keep his sharks safe from being eaten.

11. A pixie who hunts small creatures, which are quite big relative to her.

12. An awakened deer who hunts wolves to turn the tables on them.

13. A trophy hunter who hunts the deadliest beasts and takes their most dangerous parts as trophies. He seeks a necromancer or golem maker to assemble these parts together and animate them to get an even more challenging prey.

14. A poacher who delights in hunting in national parks.

15. A big game hunter humanoid that's collected many trophies over the years and taxidermed them. His current hunt? An urban legend, the skin walker.

16. A man claiming to hunt his own doppelganger. Bonus points if the party comes across both of them at the same time, both claim they are the original and that the other is the doppelganger. Using zone of truth would prove that both believe they are 100% right.

17. Some goblin who once had a seagull steal his sandwich when he was 2. Now he makes seagull sandwiches every day. 

18. A savage demon-gnoll, followed by a pack, ravaging the land in their insatiable thirst to hunt and consume. And the more they consume the stronger Yeenoghu gets. 

19. The Doom of the Gods. The Unforgiving. The God Slayer. Gods' Bane. A being of unfathomable power, capable of destroying whole worlds. Almost impossible to track and of completely unknown nature and origin. It travels back and forth between realms, hunting down Gods. Ancient scripts long lost, written by dead sages, claim that the creature is a natural force born by the multiverse that seeks to restore its balance.

20. Wilfred von Keltur, normal human, who lived peaceful life in seclusion. This however all changed when bunch of wandering beastmen killed his wife and only son. Now he dedicated his whole life to killing as much beastmen by whatever means necessary.

21. A magic item artificer that hunts mystical beasts for material components.

22. Capt. Wrath, a pirate hunter. Formerly a pirate himself, he was thrown overboard by his shipmates over a misunderstanding. Though drowning, he did not die. In a limbo state, he was contacted by a sea wraith who offered him a chance at revenge in exchange for serving her. Now an undead Warlock, Wrath uses a mix of his own cunning and mystical abilities to track pirates across the sea and bring them to a swift end. (Could be any species, but I like to think of him as Hobgoblin with entirely black eyes and a sickly green complexion) 

23. Gworf, who’s locally known as the Guyute, is a dwarven poacher who hypnotizes his victim before killing them in cold blood. He kills both man and beast, taking men’s worldly possessions and taking the hide and bones of animals, but Gworf always leaves the meat of his prey behind, to feed the ghost that haunts him but empowers him with illusory and hypnotic powers. 

24. Lavender. Hunter and chef knows many recipes and hunts for fun.

25. Lady Fortune, a wealthy human noblewoman who lures adventurers to her compound where she hunts them for sport.

26. P'nut, a kobold who hunts any kobold trying to leave their clan, especially those that have befriended adventurers.

27. Anox Relm, a pseudonym used by any number of dwarves hunting for the lost gold of The Mountain Queen. Why they always act alone, and with such ruthlessness, is a mystery.

28. The Urchinbane. Has an amulet of water breathing. Calls himself a hunter, but has more in common with a gatherer considering his prey...

29. Lillet the Blind: Lillet is a tall, dark skinned woman with long white hair and wears a white eibe. She wears a white blindfold over her eyes and dual wields silver swords. She hunts down those who have escaped justice.

30. Pyrric the Gourmont: Pyrric is a large orc who loves cooking. His goal is to hunt down every type of meat and learn to cook it to perfection. Unfortunately that does include sentient creatures. He's had human plenty of times, but more rare races and creatures will draw his murderous interest.

40. The time shark is a large spectral shark that swims through time and steals years of it's victims lives to extend its ownife. Victims rapidly age when the time shark swims through them.

41. Bean. Bean is a little creature that is two feet tall and looks like, well, a bean with a face and a propeller har. Beans carries a hammer that is much bigger than he is. He hunts down people named Josh.

42. An obsessive cowboy who hunts down cheaters at poker. He will lure them into a match and shoot with his gun under the table as soon as he sees a cheat.

43. A disgruntled seagull who had his pile of trash food taken by a garbage man. He searches far and wide for anyone wearing a green jumpsuit and poops on their heads."

24. Something is prowling the lord’s land killing villagers that are outside at night. The people live under constant terror. Bonus points if said thing is the result of the lord’s secret heinous acts or something of the sort.
25. Similar to the previous, the whole area becomes cursed. The lord offers a reward to anyone who can alleviate the curse. (Or, in this case, the PCs as the lords need to find the source of the curse).

26. A classic: one of the villages holds a lottery in which the winner is stoned to death.
27. Their nation is at war and their King is requiring his Lords to recruit new soldiers for the war effort in their area of influence. There is unspoken hesitancy from the locals to send their loved ones to battle.

30. The King asked this lord to host a banquet at their city and they are frantically running around trying to plan and prepare for it to impress them. They are unsure what the King likes for food, activities, & expectations. They could use some insight.
31. Villagers are getting sick and the lord can't seem to figure out the cause. Some say its a curse, others believe the water has been contaminated. If it doesn't stop soon, more innocent life could be lost.

36. The lord has recently inherited a portion of land that's being disputed by the local government.

If she doesn't get it soon, she's threatening to punch people... Rumour has it that she punched the demon to death.
56. A hill near the lords' domain has recently been subject to contested mining attempts by rival dwarf clans; while caring little for the territorial rights of sun-siders, one clan decides to petition the lords for mining privileges, while the other promises retribution unless the lords stay out of dwarven affairs.
57. A very polite (and well-dressed!) hobgoblin comes to court to offer his band's services as bandit-hunters. They're quite efficient, but the locals are certain to be upset about the idea of armed, state-sanctioned goblinoids marching about...
58. A distant holding has refused to pay their taxes in full. Those charged with collecting that holding's tax prove themselves of mixed trustworthiness.
59. A watercourse that is crucial for transport has suddenly shifted. Losses due to the flooding threaten the ability to collect taxes in several holdings in the area, unless the flooding is mitigated; it appears that the shifting was not caused naturally.
60. The heads of at least two economically crucial holdings have suddenly begun feuding, with little notice. One holding takes things too far, and another retaliates, escalating the issue further.
61. The head of an economically depressed holding in your lands claims that a distant holding of another lord has begun feuding with them. The problem is, that other holding has significant trading ties with some of your other holdings and supplies goods and materials that are difficult to get otherwise, and are somewhat crucial to your industrial needs. You have an significant economic incentive to lean towards the other lord's holding's economic interests, and disregard the interests of your holding-hands in this case, but doing so will surely lose the loyalty of some of your own holdings and those allied with them.
62. The Liege-lord has arrived, and hospitality is required, demanding an extended stay and banquet. During the banquet, the liege-lord has the gall to seize a significant portion of the most developed and lucrative lands they granted to you, and in a display of sheer nepotism, announces their award to another, who is also present.

66. While clearing the frontier of your lands, your commoners discover a pocket-realm; an area that is bigger on the inside than it is on the outside. Outside it occupies only a small, single valley. Inside it is several dozen times larger. It is filled with dangerous beasts, which prove to threaten holdings in the area, and dangle the possibility of fabulous wealth inside.
67. Sudden food shortages show that many granaries in a majority of your holdings have suddenly proven to be empty, despite reporting to be full. Some of the administrators of those holdings have proven themselves trustworthy in the past, and they claim no prior knowledge of the issue.
68. The Most High, Holy Fraternal Order of Artificers has suddenly, and without warning, declared you anathema, and refuse to work within your lands. Many of the common machines like mills and even the local blacksmiths are technically under their remit! Everything in your lands might grind to a halt, seize up, and break, if the misunderstanding is not resolved.
69. A nearby lord has mines that are significantly larger than your own. They actively begin dumping a larger supply of ore on the market, depressing the value of the ore your can produce. The most economical path of transport nearby crosses their lands, and they have instituted a tax (which may or may not be legal, but your own traders struggle to avoid them) on ores that cross them via the transport route.
70. One of your holdings have no heirs. Another of your holdings has them to spare, and the heirs have begun feuding with each other. A third holding (powerful, but one still nominally subservient to you) threatens to actively oppose any choice you make to resolve the matter, unless it benefits them.
71. A bunch of annoying adventurers trying to convince you to pay them quadruple of what you offered for a quest when you can literally see them casting spells to boost their charisma right in front of you
72. A clan of hill giants have been spotted on the outskirts of the lord’s lands. At first they were mostly harmless and avoided people aside from stealing the occasional livestock. Now they’ve grown bold, they’ve ransacked two homesteads already and are threatening a larger village with destruction.
73. A renowned adventurer has been seen traveling through the land. While generous and friendly to the local they seem to be avoiding the lord’s officials and emissaries. What could they be up to?
74. here have been credible reports of certain town guards taking bribes and harassing merchants for ‘protection’. The guard captain is seemingly obvious to this though rumors claim he is corrupt and has been for some time.
75. A trade caravan from a distant kingdom is requesting additional protection from the the lord’s men to ensure safe passage through the land. They’ll confide in the lord that they transporting a rare and valuable artifact and are taking no chances with it’s safety.
76. Long ago, one of the previous lords ordered the beheading of a witch. As her head rolled, with her last breath she uttered a curse that doomed any and all future lords of this land to suffer her wrath. As the new lords of this fiefdom, you must figure out the mystery surrounding this and lift the curse, lest you become the next victims.
77. The local hermit has left his cave for the first time in decades to speak with you about a vision he had of a coming threat. Is this a warning from some divine power, or simply the ravings of a madman?
78. A certain town in your lands has come down with an inexplicable dancing fever. Investigate the cause.
79. This year's harvest was ruined by a strange blight, and as a result many of the villagers will not have enough food or money to last through the winter. How are you going to help them?

81. A farmer's prize bull is valued for the valuable calves he throws, but he's an absolute menace, breaking down a fence to gore an innocent passerby.
82. A new plant has appeared and is invading gardens and fields. Some claim it is good to eat, others that it makes you sick.
83. A large band of armed travelers takes up lodgings for an undefined period. Their story doesn't seem plausible, but nobody can identify any specific threat.
84. The birds are still around, but they don't sing anymore.
85. A local farmer is growing bumper crops of a valuable fruit. The neighboring lord claims that he enjoys a monopoly on the fruit due to a longstanding royal grant, but documentation on this alleged grant seems sketchy.
86. A very popular local priest has retired. His replacement is very unpopular.
87. An architect, stonemason or engineer has shown up offering his services for any number of public works projects or fortifications- but this patronage is not cheap.
88. A duke opportunistically lays siege to neighboring fiefs. It's whispered he made a fiendish pact for the service of, or knowledge of how to build, unnatural weapons of war.
89. A cult has taken root in lands under your control, possibly even branching into your own court.
90. A surprise inspection of the local militia or town guard went disastrously. Corruption, incompetence, and more- you'll likely need to sack your castle-guard and find a new one.
91. A merchant comes to your court and complains that his caravans have been getting robbed when traveling through your lands, and he's demanding payment.
92. One of the kitchenhands has been caught sneaking into the wine cellar and getting drunk on the finest, most expensive wines.

95. A band of ragtag refugees from a nearby crisis turn up on your doorstep and ask for permission to stay. The local population is divided on the matter. Some want to help, other fear the foreigners or worry about having enough supplies to feed everybody.
96. A band of mercenaries is offering their services. They seem only mostly trustworthy but their price is good.
97. A smuggler has been caught. They are smuggling in goods from a rival fiefdom and the lost tax hurts your rival more than you. But letting a smuggler go, does not look good on you.
98. A rich artisan from town claims his mother-in-law poisoned his food to get rid of him. His wife claims her mother is just a terrible cook.
99. Several townspeople got their hair cut off when they were asleep. They accuse the old eccentric herbalist, believing she needs the hair to place a curse on them.
100. A classic for the end: Peasant A claims Peasant B borrowed his tools, then a week later returned them in highly degraded state, broken handle, notched blades etc. Peasant B insists he returned the tools in exactly the condition they were borrowed in. It has already come to blows in the market square before their wifes dragged them before you to settle the matter."
91,"for context am making a resident evil esque mini dungeon in a 3 story building ran by a doctor that my players will be trapped in from dusk till dawn. to keep them on their toes random things in the environment will shift as time goes on in rooms they have explored already, as I plan on there being some back tracking to the nature of the puzzles in the dungeon. some of it will be harmless scares for sharp eyes players, others will be traps appearing were there were none before that do minimal damage beyond making the players paranoid of the house.

I wouldnt worry to much about getting exact rooms and more just things to mess with the players heads. if anyone here has heard of the mortuaries' assistant think that for what am going for.

&#x200B;

1. a doorway in the building now has broken glass strewn across the grown
2. books fly off a bookcase and scatter on the floor
3. a room strewn with corpses' of long dead well loved npcs, with ""you killed us"" written in blood
4. a corpse appears, sitting in a chair or lying in a bed
5. a corpse disappears
6. pristine medical equipment is now rusty and blood covered
7. the next door way a player steps through will take them into a room they have already been in
8. the doors will slam and lock shut, attempting to split the party.
9. bloody foot prints will appear.
10. a pc's loved one will be found hanged, if they approach it will cry saying ""I thought you loved me""
11. a door to a small room slams locked and will only open when ""something in the room dies"" if the players wait for 10 minutes the door will unlock as they were ""killing time"""
92,"Quests or adventures you'd find in the feywild, get from a fey, or involve the fey.

1. A peasant couple are wondering if their youngest child is a changeling and asks the party to investigate. They're not, but the older child is.
2. A fey asks the party to play a prank on a mean old woman who tried to swat them. That mean old woman ends up being a hag.
3. The party meets an elven-looking man suffering from heatstroke. He ends up being a winter fey and his response to the party differs depending on if they help or leave him.
4. The party receives an invitation to a fey ball. Once they arrive, a murderer occurs and the party are the only ones cleared as they weren't there when the crime occurred so they can play detective.
5. A fey appears selling knock-off magic items. They certainly all work... just with... let's say ""unfortunate"" side effects.
6.  A member of the Unseelie Court hires the PC(s) to crash a Seelie Court function. ""Just be big, brutish, and foul. Disrupt proceedings, but don't hurt anyone. Use this Sending Stone to tell me when you've finished."" It's a trap. The Sending Stone is paired with a rival's Sending Stone. That rival will be implicated in a crime, or embarrassed. Oh, and the Fae guards will attack the offending PC(s). (To be nice, maybe they use amnestics and send them on their way.)
7.  Fey Mirrorshades: A fey claims they want something from another, contracting the party to acquire it. They openly monologue about their intentions, and are quite (loudly) convincing about their sincerity, (loudly) earnest about the need for discretion, etc. A truly insightful character might detect multiple levels of manipulation and deception; In sum: the Fey doesn't really care about the job being completed well, only that it is attempted, giving a false identity that will lead to a third party, if the job's Mark discovers the job in-process and the party is eliminated or interrogated, then in a sense, the true mission will have been successful, and the party are simply an expendable, deniable pawns aimed at triggering a feud between two third-parties. If the party does well, and actually acquires the macguffin, then it will be destroyed in front of the players, who will then be rewarded, and having revealed their capability, moved themselves into a ""potentially useful, not expendable"" category. The destruction of the macguffin still serves their purposes, as it weakens the third party they are targeting.
8.  An unfortunate being is serving five Fey creatures at a restaurant. Each creature has a favorite drink, main dish, a preference for the color of dishestensils, a preference for where they sit, and a dessert. This puzzle is given in the form of one of those “Logic Puzzles”; i.e ‘the creature with blue dishes does not like porridge’. Solve the puzzle while the kitchen preps the meals!
9. The party just enter the Fey Wild for the first time, they stumble upon a Satyr who asks if they would help him on a quest. ""Great!"" he exclaims ""May I have your name?"" he poses the question as an introduction of sorts. ""Thank you"" be says plainly and bows at the first party member to give their name. The Satyr runs off, never to be seen again. from now on any time the PC says their name you mention that they, or anyone else, are unable to refer to themselves by name. No writing it down, no saying it out loud, any past documents are now blank, your name is gone. You exist, just not your name. Quest over, unless you wanna go after the Satyr.
10.  ""Hey, you see that old man over there? The one with all the canaries? You should go and tie his shoe laces together when he's not looking.""
11. A Hag in a bottle asks to be let out... or at the very least kill her two traitorous sisters that trapped her in there.
12. A Satyr is looking for a bottle of jhuild to impress a sorceress. He's willing to pay top coin for a bottle.
13. A Coure wants to be snuck into the Underdark to find a Gloura. They were raised by the same Oread and she wanted to see them both one last time before she passes.
14.  ""I've got an infestation of fairies. You want this enchanted fly swatter or the flame thrower?""
15. strange lights are seen off in the woods near a village the party is offered food and lodging for free for a week if they go investigate
16. a new fairy mound is then discovered, and a very odd adventure ensues
17. possible finding is a clan of fairies were driven from their old mound some distance away and THEY offer the party a 'great' reward if they destroy the nasty thing that now sits on their old home.
18. Trees are infesting a local farmer's aurochs. Just sprouting right out of their backs and shoulders. The aurochs don't seem to be in pain or even bothered, but the farmer is trying to sell them for meat and he's worried the deal will fall through.
19. A village of pixies crossed over and seeded the aurochs to make mobile homes.
20.  A Quickling has stolen a Moonstone Dragon’s prized possession: an actual moon rock. The dragon wants you to capture the Quickling or get the stone back somehow."
93,"So my most recent character is part of a religion where it is believed that righteous people can perform miracles in times of need. These people then become god-saints and gain a degree of divine power after death, being worshipped by the faithful. I am seeking input on various saints and what their miracles could be. I tried looking at the list of Christian saints first but most of them are just ""this monk was really dedicated"" or ""this missionary was killed by heathens"" 😅

The deeds can be a bit absurd as many of the real stories are, they should be ultimately respectable though, not something like ""he farted really hard and killed a goblin"".

94,"This is taking some inspiration from Studio Ghibli films, which have some very powerful witches and wizards with one special weak point—the oaths they’ve sworn to while they were still in schooling. For Howl of Howl’s Moving Castle, he must come to the castle whenever summoned. For Yubaba from Spirited Away, she must give a job to whoever asks. I felt this has potential for creating powerful NPC characters with glaring weak points that’re for useful plot purposes. Did they take this oath at a royal school? Did they take this oath because it’s passed down by all in their secret coven? Feel free to experiment with origins.

95,"Ed: damn, I shouldn't be surprised by now, but y'all really brought it with great additions!  I wish I could change the post title, we're well on our way to 100 reasons.

1. To protect their secret identity - the mask-wearer makes a lot of enemies, and wants to keep their loved ones safe from reprisal.
2. The mask-wearer is famous (or infamous), and doesn’t want to be recognized.
3. In imitation of another mask-wearer whom they admire, like a romantic highwayman.
4. It's a separate intelligent entity, and it's using the host body as a puppet.  Or perhaps it *is* the character; the body supporting the mask is he or her corpse (thanks,!).
5. It's a separate intelligent entity, and they work together.
6. To protect the identity of another person; e.g., the wearer has a sibling or other person who could get in trouble if this person's face was seen.
7. That's not a mask - that's their face!  (thank you,!)
8. To conceal their gender (thank you,!).
9. To conceal their race or species (thank you, LichWriter!).  An orc who travels in elven lands may feel he should conceal his true nature... which could be comical if it's perfectly obvious from his accent, build, height, and voice that he's an orc.  Or perhaps he's something far worse, disguised as an incompetent orc to throw off suspicion?
10. Just to be cool.  Why not?
11. As penance for some misdeed.
12. For cultural, ritual, or religious reasons.
13. Sentimental value (thanks, LichWriter and NecessaryCornflake!).  Who gave it to them?  Are they utterly devoted to that person, do they simply feel obliged, or would they be happy to ditch it if someone just pointed out that they don't need to keep carting it around?
14. Like a plague doctor's mask, it contains sweet-smelling herbs to make poor parts of the city bearable (thank you, LichWriter!).
15. To enforce anonymity among the organization, as in Ganesha's veiled monks in the web comic *Digger*.
16. They're very attractive (magically so?), and don't want to get special privileges or get unwanted advances (thanks,!).
17. They love attention and want to stand out (thanks, VeritasVarmint and!).
18. It's a fashion statement (thanks, VeritasVarmint!).
19. It helps them to feel more confident (thanks, NecessaryCornflake!).  Perhaps their true self is the butt of ridicule, but pretending to be someone else lets them transcend that?
20. It's cursed; if they take it off, they will suffer in some way - or perhaps they can’t take it off at all.
21. It's cursed; *others* will suffer if they see his or her true face (thanks, and!).  What's the effect?  A gorgon famously turns people to stone, and a cockatrice kills, while in *D&D* seeing a nymph's face stuns.
22. It's been prophesized that as long as he or she wears it, they cannot die.
23. To protect themselves from the elements, such as blowing sand.
24. As armor for the face (thanks, World of Ideas!).
25. As protection against a peculiar type of physical attack, like facehuggers.
26. As protection against magical or psychic attacks, such as telepathy (thanks, World of Ideas!).
27. To cover scars or other perceived ugliness; e.g., they lost their nose in the war (thanks, Salad-Burrito!)
28. To protect themselves from *getting* scars, bruises, or other disfigurement while they fight (thanks,!).
29. To conceal signs of magic use, like glowing scars or runes.
30. To stop the spread of disease.
31. To conceal a brand or tattoo, perhaps one which marks them as an escaped prisoner, slave, or discriminated-against ethnicity (thank you, Salad-Burrito!).
32. To conceal tattoos they got when they were young and stupid (thank you, Salad-Burrito!).
33. It's a life-support device, sustaining them after a terrible injury such as molten metal to the face (thanks,!).  ""*No.*  ***I*** *am your father!""*
34. Their face is actually broken, and only the mask is holding it together (thanks, NecessaryCornflake!).  They might have terrible leprosy, or a curse; in a high-tech world, maybe their avatar is crumbling from a computer virus, and the mask is a software patch that is keeping them together.
35. It's enchanted or high-tech, perhaps granting superior sight, air filtration, or water breathing (thanks, FirstChaos and World of Ideas!).
36. It blocks or suppresses the wearer's magical power, which they don't want to use all the time (thanks, DiamondMx!).  Maybe they're telepathic or can see ghosts, but they can't control the ability; the mask is necessary to avoid going mad.  *Farscape* fans will probably think of [Stark](
37. The mask isn't inherently magical, but the wearer uses it as their focus (thanks, World of Ideas!).
38. It's a holy symbol (thanks, World of Ideas!).
39. It contains pouches of various fluids for the wearer to breath or drink (thanks, World of Ideas!).  ""Care for another sip of strength potion, Mr. Dorrance?  Don't mind if I do!""
40. To be intimidating.
41. To keep the sun off their face (thank you, Salad-Burrito!).  They may also have a wide-brimmed hat, thick skin cream, and possibly a pair of fangs.
42. To support the artisan (thank you,-Burrito!).  Be careful, if you ask about it they may go off for ten minutes about how wonder that mask-maker is.
43. Similar, but *they* are the artist (thank you, NecessaryCornflake!).  ""You like it?  I made it myself.  You can have your own, custom-made, for nine easy payments of only 49 gold pieces!  Put your deposit down today!""
44. It's stuck; they physically can't remove it (thank you, NecessaryCornflake!).
45. It's spiked, poisoned, or otherwise enhanced to make for more deadly headbutting attacks (thanks, World of Ideas!).
46. It's a weapon in its own right: maybe it can be thrown, or it unfolds into a sword (thanks, DiamondMx!).
47. To blend in, as the wearer is infiltrating a group who wears masks (thanks, World of Ideas!).
48. The mask prevents demons, fae, spirits, undead, or some other class of monster from recognizing you as human (thanks, World of Ideas!).
49. It's the accepted means of showing that you're blind, like dark glasses in our world (thanks,!).  Editors note: do blind people actually wear dark glasses, or is that just a cartoons thing?
50. The mask has hidden compartments, used for smuggling small quantities of valuables (thanks, DiamondMx!).
51. Their true face constantly changes; they wear a mask so others will have a consistent point of reference to recognize (thanks, [IAMATruckerAMA](
52. Their real face reflects how they feel too well, perhaps changing colors when they're feeling intense emotions or trying to lie.  They wear a mask to have some hope of keeping a poker face when they need to.
53. The mask is a key of some sort (thanks, World\_of\_Ideas!).
54. It grants magical power, such as control over the type animal portrayed, or the ability to turn into such creatures (thanks, World\_of\_Ideas!).
55. The mask is a symbol of office (thanks, World\_of\_Ideas!).
56. [It’s just they’re terribly comfortable. I think everyone will be wearing them in the future.](
96,"There's a lot of interesting ways to spice up an encounter and add a bit of extra dimension to combat in order to make it more appealing to your players. Anything that forces strategy, creativity, or creates an obstacle that the players have to work around can help your encounters go from mundane to marvelous. However, some of the more well-known strategies like falling boulders, collapsing tunnels, and shifting pathways don't really translate well in a Grasslands terrain with an open field.

Help me think of Grasslands-specific terrains, obstacles, or other than can be used to spice up a combat encounter in this environment!

1. When creatures travel over certain areas on the field, they cause a kaleidoscope of butterflies to erupt from that area and disperse creating quarter cover for the creature that triggered it for one round while simultaneously distracting them, giving them a -2 to attack rolls.

2. A small stream runs through the area, but it is covered by thick grasses growing across it and a slight drop off into the water. Without a passive perception of 14 or higher, a creature assumes it is solid ground and must make a Dexterity saving throw of 13 in order to get across or fall in. Climbing out costs half their movement speed. Remaining in the stream gives them half cover but gives them disadvantage on any attacks not within 5ft on the banks of the stream.

3. Patches of dandelions dot the battlefield, and walking through them causes them to be released into the air. Without a successful constitution save of 12, they induce sneezing which forces the creature into a fit of sneezing. The players must navigate around these areas as they fight or risk losing their bonus action on their turn.

4. On a predetermined round, a herd of wild horses run through the area in their direction. A passive perception of 12 can see them coming from afar, but all will see them coming the round before. Will they choose to move out of the way or assume the horses will actively avoid them? Is something chasing the horses that the players might become distracted by?

5. Vultures circle from above, waiting to see the outcome of the battle. If anyone goes unconscious they may become impatient and swoop down on them before they can roll death saving throws!

6. Crows are feeding on the plentiful bugs populating the area. Disturbing their space could have them coming after you, and not only do crows gang up on offenders but they never forget someone who has wrong them...

7. As the encounter begins, a storm can be seen on the horizon quickly rolling in. On a set round, it hits the area erupting into a series of lightning strikes. Creatures must roll a d6 and on a 1 make a Dexterity saving throw of 15 or take lightning damage. If they are holding or wearing anything made of metal, they automatically fail the saving throw. This storm could last for several rounds.

8. Raging winds drive the characters around the battlefield, changing direction each turn. Each creature medium or smaller must succeed on a strength saving throw of 13 at the beginning of each of their turns or be blown 5 feet in a random direction determined by the roll of a d4 at the start of the new round.

9. A row of flowers divide the party from their foes, with tall grass on either side that makes combat nigh impossible. They only way through is across the flowers, and a passive investigation of 12 reveals them to be the same flowers used in sleeping potions. Trampling them would cause a creature to make a DC 14 constitution saving throw or fall into a deep slumber that can only be remedied by taking damage or by an ally using their action to wake them.

10. The battle revolves around the long-abandoned ruins of an ancient city that was destroyed by a natural disaster and half-hidden beneath wild grasses and flowers. The players may want to preserve these remains to investigate them later or use them as cover/high ground during battle. Either way they have not been touched in a great many years.

11. The grass here is known for being particularly dry, and with the slight breeze around them all participating in the battle understand that the use of fire or even lightning could be incredibly dangerous. They must avoid doing anything that would set off a wildfire, which could include any kind of reflective metal such as breastplate armour or shields.

12. This area is filled with heavy undergrowth, making any kind of traversing over land difficult terrain. There may also be patches of hookseeds or latchweeds that grab onto any kind of clothing, slowing down the combatants over time.

13. The area is dotted with ant hills. However, they cannot be seen until you are within 5 feet of them with a passive perception of 12 or higher. Stepping on any one of these hills angers the bugs and brings another enemy into play: swarm of ants. (Inspiration by)

14. In a more bushy area, a nest of bees clings onto a larger shrub or tree. Smacking the hive or shooting it with an arrow with an AC of 17 releases it from the branch and awakens a swarm of bees which immediately attack the closest thing to them for the rest of combat. The players may strategize to bring the enemies closer to the hive before angering the bees. (Inspiration by)

15. Lots of pocks and small holes made my Prarie dogs cause the area to become difficult terrain. Attacking recklessly becomes dangerous as it risks a twisted ankle. Anyone who weighs over 180lbs must roll a percentage die equal to the distance covered each round (30% if they walk 30feet, or 60% if the dash 60 feet) or the ground below them will crumble and break as the tunnels collapse. After this, their speed is reduced to 0 until the start of their next turn. . (Inspiration by)

16. A few large piles of dung from some kind of large grazing mammal are still wet in this area. Will cause problems walking due to the slippery quality. Creatures must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or they cannot take any actions or reactions while within 5 feet of these offerings. They can be used as a deterrent for the enemies but handle with care because getting any in an open wound could lead to infection. If a creature is knocked prone into a square containing a cowpie, they must succeed on a Constitution 14 saving throw or use their next action to throw up. (Inspiration by)

17. The plains are filled with thick prairie grass 8ft tall. A creature within the grass counts as lightly obscured at all times, and is heavily obscured to any creature more than 10ft away. For combat use the underwater combat ruleset except having a swimming speed doesn't negate the penalties.

18. You have stumbled upon the warren of some rabbits with burrows scattered everywhere. Unless you move at half speed for every 10ft you move though this area you must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone as your foot enters a burrow.

19. A tornado has suddenly changed direction and is heading towards the battlefield. It acts as a countdown clock for this encounter, changing the battlefield slightly each turn. The first two rounds are fairly normal. The second round the wind picks up to 15 miles per hour. The third round the sky darkens, casting strange shadows and causing the terrain to become dim. The fourth round the speed picks up to 35 miles per hour, making thrown weapons and projectiles obsolete. Leaves and dust spin around the battlefield, causing it to become lightly obscured. On the fifth round, the area becomes dark and hazy, everything around them becoming heavily obscured as the wind picks up to 50mph, slowing the speed of all in the area by 10 feet unless heading directly towards the direction of the tornado. On round 6, each creature is pulled 10 feet towards the tornado at the start of their turn. On round 7, the tornado hits and there is no escape.

20. A successful passive perception check of 15 will reveal a snake in the grass and nature 12 to determine it is venemous. Entering its square causes it to strike the intruder and flee (roll attack for 1 damage & save vs the poison)

21. As soon as X creatures come within 5ft of each other, a sinkhole forms in a 20ft diameter. Those creatures see the grass and rocks around them are getting taller and taler until they see fresh dirt forming around the sides of the sinkhole. Water starts to trickle up from the ground and now the players are trapped in a hole with whatever else was there. The ground at the bottom of the sinkhole becomes marshy enough to halve their speed.

22. When the combat encounter starts, characters proficient in nature may notice the creatures they're fighting are already looking ragged and appear frightened. Before the enemy creatures get to move, a larger predators dart out of the tall grass, chasing them off and taking their place in the initiative order.

23. The pollen in the grass causes an allergic reaction in one or more of the characters. This may give them the poisoned condition during the encounter, or force them to make saving throws at the start of each turn or lose their ability to see properly as their eyes tear up.

24. Powerful gusts of wind race across the open landscape unhindered. The thundering winds effectively deafen creatures while they blow, and make verbal communication between the characters impossible.

25. Characters proficient in nature may notice that the monster attacking them is actually defending their nest, which is hidden in the grass. If they withdraw, the monster will leave them be.

26. In the middle of the grassland stands an ancient stone circle. Observant characters may notice attacking monsters will not go near the stone circle, but seeking refuge here may draw the attention of some ancient spirit of the fields later on.

27. In the middle of the grassland, some of the grass has been flattened into a crop circle. Observant characters may notice attacking monsters will not go near the crop circle, but seeking refuge here may draw the attention of some unearthly force later on.

28. Sometime in the middle of combat, the ground begins to move. All combatants find themselves suddenly moving as a herd of ancient tortoises with grass on their shells rise up from beneath them, carrying them forward. Any area of effect spells are left behind as they move 10 feet per turn while the tortoises walk on their own initative. (Inspiration by)

29. Players begin to notice that the sticks they are stepping on aren't sticks, but in fact bones from various animals. They seem to have to reason to be here, but may be some sort of warning for another encounter.

30. As the clouds turn dark a rock falls near one of the players, but those aren't regular clouds! Its a spontaneous hailstorm! They better find somewhere quick if they dont wish to possibly die due to falling rocks. On each of their turns they must roll within a percentage die or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage. (Inspiration by)

31. Smoke billows in the distance, as the smoke gets closer its reveled to be a prairie fire that has to be outrun. The players have 5 rounds to finish combat before the fire blows across the battlefield in a rapid wave.

32. Someone nearly falls into an ancient sinkhole thats very deep, shiny things can be seen at the bottom. If reached its revealed to be small pools of water that give players a super jump just out of the sinkhole and wears off after one use, this water is collectable although there is little.

33. A recent convergence of ley lines has caused the grass in the area to gain limited sentience. It clings to anything moving through it creating difficult terrain. Additionally, any creature knocked prone is restrained by the grass and must use their reaction to attempt to escape with a DC13 strength check.

34. The grass that grows in the area is stiff and deceptively sharp, with blades that that can leave shallow, painful cuts. Creatures moving through the grass at greater than half speed must make a dc14 reflex save or take 1d4 slashing damage. Characters wearing medium or heavy armor, or with at least +3 natural armor are unaffected.

35. A grass fire has recently swept the area, turning the field into a expanse of black ash. Only a few smouldering remnants remain, but a gust of wind every 1d4 rounds kicks the dust up into a choking cloud, effectively blinding all creatures in the area.

36. Some mischievous fey or other force has cleverly woven some patches of the tall grass together, so that it is nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding grass, but forms a sturdy barrier to passage.

37. The enemies are fortified in a tower or other high ground, and the grassland offers little cover to make your approach.

38. A Massive section is covered in spider webbing. Players can detour, try to remove it, or power through it. Difficult Terrain. venomous spiders dont deal damage with their bite but instead grant the poisoned condition. Perhaps some of the spiders aren't tiny...

39. The tallest tufts of grass provide concealment. In addition to being difficult terrain and offering partial concealment. Creatures of medium size or smaller within the tall grass gain +1d4 on any stealth checks they make.  As an action, a creature of size small or smaller can dissapear into the tall grass if they are more than 20 feet from the nearest enemy. Creatures have disadvantage when searching for traps or hazards. (Inspiration by)

40. Devilsburr: These sharp edged seeds from a relatively innoccuous plant that smells faintly of sulfur, are motile, and posess a natural numbing agent to cut into and burrow into flesh if left untreated.  Skilled druids are sometimes able to harvest these seeds and use them to ease the pain of treating grievous wounds, but the magical effect fades a few days after harvesting.  After standing in or moving through a patch of these plants (which can be identified by a DC 14 Nature check) the victim must pass a DC 11 Constitution save or take 1d6 poison damage once each hour afterwards until the burrs are removed.  Once the effect is known, each burr may be removed surgically via a DC 16 Medicine check, in a process that deals 1d4 Slashing damage per burr on a success, and 2d4 slashing damage on a failure.  For each day the burrs remain inside the host, the DC for all physical checks go up by 2.  The burrs may be removed magically by a *Lesser Restoration* or similar spell that removes parasites.  A victim that dies from Devilsburr, unless cremated, sprouts a new patch 1d6 days after death. (Inspiration by)

41. An earthquake begins on the second round of combat, sending rippling waves across the field as if the ground is now water. At the start of each round, the combatants must make a Dexterity saving throw of 13 or fall prone. The ground becomes difficult terrain until the earthquake stops.

42. An earthquake begins on the second round of combat, causing everyone to make a DC13 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. A 3ft wide crevasse splits the ground agape, moving anyone within the area onto either side of the crack. If they are close to the edge, they must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall 30 feet into the bottom of the crevasse. Those who are prone have advantage on this save.

43. On a predetermined round, a gravity surge causes the ground underneath the combatants to stretch up from the center into a spike. They can make a DC 16 Strength saving throw to hold onto the grasses and plants to stay where they are, or they can roll down to the bottom of the spike. This surge lasts for 3 rounds and forces the players to fight around it until it returns to normal.

44. On a predetermined round, a gravity surge causes all creatures and any items not half-buried to rise up 5 feet into the air. Anything with a flying speed can act normally, anything with a swimming speed can move at half speed, and anything without either of those can only move 5 feet per round (or 10 feet with a dash). On the next round, all creatures unable to grab onto anything float upwards another 5 feet. On the round after that, everything falls and returns to normal.

45. On a predetermined round, a gravity anomaly causes everyone to become lighter than usual. Jumping distance is doubled, falling speed and walking speeds are both halved, and the range of thrown weapons and projectiles increases by half the normal distance (+50% range).

46. A couple clusters of 2ft tall, spindly white-blue fungus that sparkle like fresh snow grow in this area. Damaging them causes spores to erupt and cover an adjacent square with slippery ice. If a person is in this square when it becomes covered, they must succeed on a DC10 Constitution saving throw or become petrified for one round. If a person touches the shroom directly without covering, that part of their body becomes frozen for 1d4 rounds. Each mushroom grows in a cluster of 3-5 and only has one charge of their frost ability. 

47. Several spiral-shaped neon yellow mushrooms with concave heads grow in this area. Damaging one causes spores to erupt in the direction the head is facing. Any creatures that are in this area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed for one round. Each shroom has 3 charges.

48. Several clusters of rainbow-coloured mushrooms in dark tones primarily purple hide beneath the grass. If a creature steps on one, they must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or begin to hallucinate for 30 seconds. They see enemies that are not there, causing them to attack in random spaces where there is not an ally present.

49. The plants around the area are covered in a light green mold. If a creature gets some of this substance on their skin, they must succeed on a DC8 Constitution saving throw or take one necrotic damage immediately unless they are immune to disease. Each minute this damage increases, gaining a +1 every minute as they take damage. A creature that is immune to poison will not feel these effects until 5 minutes after contact but will still take damage normally. Once 30 minutes has passed, the damage no longer increases but the mold will begin to eat at their flesh in a way that healing spells cannot cure until a restoration or remove curse spell is cast to kill the mold, or until the affected area is removed.

97,"In a [popular module]( for Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition, there is a chapter that regularly features [fairy rings]( which, once activated, could take adventurers to **a remote location on any world of the material plane**. Let's build a list of fun destinations!

What's a fun destination?

* it's not a side-adventure, just a fun place where you can find something memorable. Exploring it completely should not take up more than 60 mins. in a TTRPG.
* please describe a location in a fantasy world
* don't choose a location in outer space or on other planes of existence
* don't reference other media (i.e. Critical Role, Game of Thrones, etc.)

Bonus points!? \[OPTIONAL\]

* is there maybe some sort of **creature(s)** suitable for a friendly/neutral/hostile encounter nearby?
* is there an opportunity for the party to **gain or loose** a thing nearby?

##d100 Destinations of a Fairy Ring!

1. a dark cavern, illuminated only by another fairy ring, glowing in faint blue light. You hear rushing water nearby (hidden in the water is an iron skeleton clutching a blue gem).
2. a grove in a forest during a lunar eclipse. You are standing in the middle of a stone circle, where a dozen masked satyrs just interrupted their ritual dance. If you manage to calm them down and join their dance, you can gain a blessing lasting 7 days.
3. a large crater submerged in water. You can see a faint glow over the water surface above you. (leading to an air-filled cavern beneath the ocean, where a huge crab mama is not happy to find you invading her nest).
4. the top level of a round stone tower, 300 ft. high, where moss is growing around you in a perfect circle. The only way down is a (stuck) trapdoor. Beneath is a strange laboratory, from where you can salvage alchemist's tools and magical ring hidden on the finger of a skeleton that might try to keep it.
5. a circle made of plague fungus, growing on the tongue of a purple worm. Roll initiative.
6. an unfurnished wooden building with a large open door, rounded off at the top. The walls and floor are wooden, painted red and yellow respectively. If the players peer out of the door, there is a long cylinder of unpainted wood jutting out the bottom of the doorframe, and the players realize they are in a giant oversized birdhouse resting on the branch of a giant forest as if they have shrunk! Perhaps some sort of giant bird encounter? [/TalonWolf1313]
7. an underground cavern atop a 15ft mound-like island surrounded by water, lightless, soundless, and with tens or even hundreds of bodies floating atop the water. Gear is abundant here, magic items less so. As the party moves to loot a stream of lighting is fired toward them from a serpentine figure in the water, a Behir. [/PixelledSage]
8. A room with a chest, the chest is fine but the coins inside are mimics. [/UmbramonOrSomething]
9. In the exact same spot, having been shrunk 200-300x smaller. It's difficult to identify that they haven't moved due to the change of scale. The blades of grass stand taller than the PC and any nearby bugs are the size of cats, dogs, or horses.
They can find a seed which they can barely carry. That seed will upsize with the PC when they return to their regular size, and is the start of a giant strain of that particular plant. [/RuggerRigger]
10. Deep in a forest with trees too tall to see the top of. The forest is strangely devoid of life. The only sound that can be heard is the droning of some unfathomably colossal creature, getting louder and louder. [/SnowseaGames]
11. Inside a strange, non-euclidean temple, made of pale stone staircases and archways of varying orientation. [/SnowseaGames]
12. On a massive table belonging to giant humanoid creatures. They are playing D&D. They are surprised to see you, but they need some extra minis for an encounter, so they ask you to stand in. [/SnowseaGames]
13. A massive plantation of giant trees, with giants of all types visiting. Turns out this is a Graveyard of Giants where giants bury their dead and plant a tree upon the corpse. It has created a magical forest of trees acting as grave markers. Giants visit to pay respect to their ancestors. [/TheOnlyCorwin
]
14. A small pond in the middle of a forest containing a Rusalka that tries to lure people to her pond with their beauty. se Sea Hag stats) [/TheOnlyCorwin
]
15. An outhouse at a farm 2d6 miles from a city of note. The farm is small, and the farmer is older, and is willing to share his food, in exchange for helping with his chores. [/QuantumDiogenes]
16. A cramped, damp cave, 200 feet underground. The cave entrance requires a DC 25 escape check. Other than clean water, and sharp ricks, there is nothing to note here. [/QuantumDiogenes]
17. The doorway to a ruined home. There is naught but rubble, some knickknacks worth 1d3 gold, spiders and other vermin, and the strangely intact doorway.
18. Room 137 in the Mathematical Inn, a medium sized inn. All the room numbers are primes, the beds are soft, and there is a huge library of scholarly books. Staying here a night will fully restore the party. [/QuantumDiogenes]
19. The basement to the Air Genasi Inn, a tourist trap hotel run by some incubus. They are calm, and not outwardly hostile to the party, but they will not rent a room, nor will they allow the party to stay any longer than necessary. [/QuantumDiogenes]
20. A storeroom to a dwarven refinery. There is lots of useless looking rocks, a few tankards of ale, and a days worth of foodstuffs hidden around the room. [/QuantumDiogenes]
21. A small pool, filled with clean, cool, clear water. Elven clothing is located in a small chest near the water's edge. A knowledge check, DC 10, will ID this place as an elven bath. [/QuantumDiogenes]
22. The party arrives deep, deep in a forest. Close to their spawnpoint stands a slightly startled white deer. It is not hostile and will guide the party to the return circle, but only if they try to befriend it and don't startle it any further. If they do it runs away, leaving them stranded and having to search for the circle themselves. [/ClairLestrange]
23. In the cellar of a tavern. The door into the tavern is open, however they either have to sneak out or have a damn good story how they got down there so they won't be kicked out by the owner. If they manage to either get past him in the tavern room or convince him they aren't here to steal they can get some drinks and a nurturing bowl of soup. [/ClairLestrange]
24. An owl bear nest. Mama is pretty pissed at the intruders, but maybe a share of their rations will calm her down. [/ClairLestrange]
25. A wooded grove filled with soft grass, dotted with fairy circles as far as the eye can see. [/drolldignitary]
26. A large, rumbling, wet cave, that turns out to be the belly of a giant. [/drolldignitary]
27. A small outcropping of earth which has detached from the ground and now floats above and between the clouds. [/drolldignitary]
28. The inside of a large geode partially filled with water. A single, hairline crack lets in enough fresh air and light for mushrooms to grow. [/drolldignitary]
29. A massive, desolate crater in the middle of a desert. Softly glowing rocks litter the crater. [/drolldignitary]
30. A fairy ring in the middle of an ongoing forest fire. If they don't hurry, the ring will be destroyed. [/drolldignitary]
31. The top of a giant mushroom. The weight of a medium creature causes them to sink through the soft flesh of the mushroom into its gills. [/drolldignitary]
32. A copse of trees which is being cleared to make way for the construction of a railroad. Iron spikes and rails are being driven into the cleared ground by laborers. [/drolldignitary]
33. A room in a pixie's home. Medium creatures arriving through the ring crash through the roof. [/drolldignitary]
34. An ongoing festival, filled with crowds of satyrs, nymphs, dryads, etc. The party is visibly out of place, but there are stations to make flower crowns and to get facepaint. [/drolldignitary]
35. In the branches of a giant tree. The tree must be at least 500ft tall. You can see a giant (bird, squirrel) nest on the branch that you are on. [/World_of_Ideas]
36. the party finds the patrons of a very confused, but intrigued fey dinner party. [/swiftcrayon502]
37. The circle of a spotlight on a stage in a large city, where actors are performing a play set in the Feywild. If the PCs leave the spotlight they are sent back. The light is focused on a big stage prop (mech. dragon/ stone tower/evil hag/ dancing fawn/ raging fire). The actors may or may not notice the PCs. [/BafflingHalfling]
38. A circle of glowing lichen growing on small stone outcropping in the highest reaches of a frozen mountain range. It is strangely still warm inside the circle, and there is no snow or ice within it. A crystal sword (or frost brand sword) is carved out of the ice just beyond the lichen. There are what appear to be arm bones and frozen arms just beyond the circle. If they can figure out how to pry the sword out of the ice without leaving the circle, it is theirs. Otherwise, the first limb to exit the circle freezes, if they do not use their reaction to pull back... Well, I'll leave that up to you. [/BafflingHalfling]
39. A natural kettle gorge in a magical desert, filled somehow with a layer of fog rising up over a mile into the sky, comprised of finely powdered salts, peroxides, and silicates that remain in suspension and within the area in even the strongest gales. Something about the area causes water to disappear, even that stored in sealed containers. An eerie, everpresent wind storm rages, but the fog does not vanish. The fog rubbing leads to static electricity, dry lightning strikes, and the epitaxial growth of large crystals that sing and vibrate musically when the winds blow. Finding the return ring will be difficult, as it is made of crystal instead of fungus. Leaving the area is difficult as well, it seems the walls of the gorge are steep, and seemingly never end, although this is just an naturally occuring enchantment that can be resisted with a Difficult DC save. A handful of dessicated adventurers can be found here, a few entombed and encrusted with the crystals. Some have died by violence; they have loot. [/MaxSizeIs]
40. A slippery, narrow bridge over a chasm high on a snowy mountain. A friendly and curious yeti, Wuentstyl, helps travellers cross the bridge. [/badgerbaroudeur]
41. A long road through a cold, dark pine forest. Among the trees are two goblins/red caps /spriggans who got trapped in a pit trap [/badgerbaroudeur]
42. A pier on a quiet beach. There's only one building nearby , which seems to be a rather empty inn. It's not clear why the inn needs a pier, or come to that, how it stays in business being so empty [/badgerbaroudeur]
43. A field full of sheep. A magic creature (dryad? Elemental? Fey? ) wants help spinning the sheeps wool into yarn [/badgerbaroudeur]
44. The party ends up on a small lookout point overlooking a scenic waterfall. If they try to leave the cliff by any means, eg, climb down, they are returned to the fairy ring. [/QuantumDiogenes]
45. The party emerge underwater in a small, clearly manmade pool. The tiles on the bottom depict a pattern similar to the fairy ring they just left. The surface is close and the water is pleasantly warm (though their clothes are now soaked). On investigation, they find that they are in a public bathhouse. [/itokro]
46. the PCs find themselves in the eternally filled, tasty, fancy, pastry tray and cute kitten lounge. [/wagner56]
47. A small grove located in an indent in a large rock, with mushrooms growing everywhere, including in another fairy circle around the PCs. If anyone leaves then reenters the fairy circle, they are transported back to the original fairy circle they entered through. If anyone disturbs the mushrooms, they release a cloud of spores that cover the area and everyone in the grove must make a CON save to avoid inhaling them. Anyone who fails is polymorphed into a myconid for 1d4 days. [/Aninx]
48. A room where fairies are playing games. Upon seeing the PCs, they'll excitedly invite them to play games with them and offer a wager where they'll give them different fairy traits depending on if they win or lose. If a PC plays and wins, the fairy will either give them wings with a fly speed of 30 ft or proficiency in persuasion or deception. If the PC loses, the fairy will either shrink them to small size or take away their ability to lie. [/Aninx]
49. A secluded lake valley surrounded by snow capped mountains on all sides. A small fey fishing village is nestled snuggly within where they catch illuminating fish on beautifully crafted boats. The lake lights up at night from the activity and subtly touches the far reaching mountains. The fey will want to buy/trade anything shiny from the party for bait. [/NecessaryCornflake7]
50. A small uniquely shaped hybrid home and workshop in the middle of a dense forest. Loud noises, lights, and vibrations will come within the workshop as they conduct an experiment. It may not go well with a small explosion and a cry of disgust. A soot covered gnome inventor will be friendly and inquire the party for alchemical materials or technological devices. [/NecessaryCornflake7]
51. You arrive in a curiously dark but exotic closet with beautiful clothing. You can only surmise you are possibly in a royal bedroom. You hear a noise from the bedroom as a captivating voice greets with a question, ""[insert random fey name] is that you? Please come in I've been waiting for you for days."" [/NecessaryCornflake7]
52. You land abruptly on a conveyor belt that moves you horizontally, you feel your body become slowly paralyzed from some mysterious magic as you helplessly see yourself moving closer and closer to some dangerous mechanical devices that appear to mash up and cook up whatever typically comes through here. You eventually smell freshly cooked and seasoned steak in the large room. You hear a loud cry as it appears there seems to be a mistake. ""Stop it, Stop it now, it is the wrong thing. They'll have our wings if we use this!"" An instant before the large industrial smasher squishes you, the device comes to a sudden halt. [/NecessaryCornflake7]
53. You arrive in a janitor closet on a white airship. Upon closer inspection it resembles a large cloud and would easily be disguised that way from the ground level. This airship operates like a fey cruise ship with tourists and staff to accommodate them. The nights are magical with the accompanying clouds, stars, and moon brightening up the sky and inviting dance parties. A staff member who sees you will ask for your boarding ticket or some kind of accommodation to look the other way. [/NecessaryCornflake7]
54. You arrive inside a small hex shaped room made of bees wax. The smell of honey is strong, the sound of bees buzzing is also just as strong. A small sized egg begins to hatch as you greet a curious and friendly newborn honeybee. The other honeybees may not be as friendly. [/NecessaryCornflake7]
55. The inside of a large golden room richly furnished with rugs and pillows. Upon closer inspection, the shape implies that the party is inside a genie's lamp. Torches are on the wall and chests of riches surround the players. One could be a mimic or there could be a curse is a player takes any treasure. [/veepower]
56. In the nest of a creature that must be the size of a house. Bones and scraps are littered around and potentially even some eggs. It's hard to far outside the nest in the dusk light, but the inhabitant of the nest could come back at any time. [/veepower]
57. On the porch of an old, beat-up cabin that has huge chicken legs (Baba-Yaga) and is slowly walking through a meadow. Inside the cabin is an old bed, rocking chair, a cauldron and a large apothecary wall. [/veepower]
58. Inside a giant cage in what appears to be some sort of zoo with all sorts of creatures in the other exhibits. It wouldn't be to hard to break out of the cage, but the inhabitants of the other cages could be any sort of dangerous monster. [/veepower]
59. In a cave full of stalagmites and stalagmites with the ceiling covered in bats. There are shallow pools of water that light the cave with bioluminescent algae. [/veepower]
60. There is a beautifully manicured garden with a hedge maze and fountains. White marble statues of horses and heroes dot the picturesque landscape. The sun sits directly above in the sky, leaving the eerie appearance that nothing has a shadow. [/veepower]
61. Surrounded in a deep forest with ancient healthy trees, nearby you hear the sound of a gentle stream of water. The ground shakes as a treant approaches as they call an army of animal creatures to encircle the nearby trees and forest ground. The sound of large tree branches creak from movement as the treant's legs move back and forth as it stomps closer to you. ""My tree siblings warned me of your entrance strangers, What brings you to my ancient woods?"" The treant asks skeptically with a guarded tone. [/NecessaryCornflake7]
62. Standing in a large and tall rugged barn that smells of paint. The walls have individual art pieces either mounted on or directly painted to the barn wood interior walls. Floating balls of light give illumination from the darkness. Art supplies, blank canvas, and Reference objects are sprawled out all over the room. A surprised fey squeals and rises in the air from fright as they turn around into your direction. Astonishment and quick witted determination fills their eyes as they begin a new canvas with you as their new subject matter. ""Hold that pose right there, It's picture perfect!"" [/NecessaryCornflake7]
63. A breezy wind of hot dry air hits your face as you see rolling dunes of a vast red desert. In front of you is a quant oasis with palm trees, lounge seats, and a drink bar. Several fey greet you over to the bar for some exotic tropical drinks and sun tan lotion. They shamefully recommend you ignore that camel skeleton on the other side of the water though. [/NecessaryCornflake7]"

103,"In a classic fantasy setting, a stop at the local tavern is a typical trope. Subvert this common experience with a surprise, mystery, or threat that isn’t immediately apparent when your players first arrive. 

## D100 Reasons the tavern isn’t all that it seems

1. **This tavern is the hangout of dangerous gang.** The locals all stay away, but travelers sometimes blunder in by mistake. The ruffians inside are silently estimating the party’s ability to defend itself. 

2. **This tavern is the stronghold of a powerful vampire.** The vampire plays the part of the charismatic bartender, and the staff are all living thralls. The vampire is a shrewd predator, selecting isolated victims who will not be immediately missed.

3. **This tavern is hanging in the precarious silence of imminent violence.** A corrupt sheriff and several deputies have confronted a criminal cell over a betrayed alliance. Threats of violence were spoken moments before the party walked in the door. 

4. **This tavern is hosting a secret gathering of local doppelgängers.** The creatures meet once a month under the guise of a card tournament, and when the party enters, furtive looks are exchanged. Having partially infiltrated the community they have come to love the folksy non-shape changing inhabitants and now wish to live in peace. They are afraid of what might happen if the PCs discover what they truly are.

5. **This tavern is being visited by an indiscrete noble having an affair.** The noble is upstairs with their lover. In the common room are several members of the noble’s staff as well as many local folks who have pocketed pouches of gold to stay silent. There is an air of exaggerated nonchalance.

6. **This tavern is being robbed.** The owners are being held at knifepoint in another room. The robbers have decided that the best way through is to play the part of the wait staff and wait for the party to leave.

7. **This tavern’s flaws are being concealed by illusions.** Desperate to impress a wealthy buyer, the owner has enlisted a wizard friend in covering up the establishment’s many, sometimes dangerous, deficiencies. Glamers conceal holes in the floor, vermin, shabby furniture, and hideous dishes.

8. **This tavern is secretly serving rat meat.** Unable to secure affordable proteins, the owner has procured several giant rat carcasses from a local hunter. The staff is uncomfortably maintaining the charade with lame excuses about the flavor of the food.

9. **This tavern is trafficking sentients.** Local prohibition laws have turned this tavern into an inn. To make ends meet, the tavernkeep has begun taking travelers in their sleep and selling them to smugglers. Victims are kept a few days in a basement until the next pickup. Rumors in the community and odd stray belongings provide clues to the true nature of the establishment. /Fukken_Ay]

10. **This tavern is defended by mimics.** The barkeep has several domesticated mimics masquerading as diners' tables. The mimics live on the table scraps plus unsold food. The locals know about this, and deliberately leave meals unfinished. Despite this, the ""tables"" stomachs sometimes growl when food is served. The protective creatures are also quick to act if they believe their master is being threatened. /an_eireannach]

11. **This tavern is a hub of spycraft.** This location has long been a meeting place for spies to meet, make deals, and exchange information. Local folks come and go from the place without harassment, but unusual patrons, like traveling adventurers, are slyly and thoroughly investigated. /snakebite262]

12. **This tavern makes people fat.** A hag with a longstanding grudge has cursed the kitchen of this tavern. The food produced here is delicious, but supernaturally fattening. All the local patrons are obese, but eat ravenously. Staying in the establishment and eating even a single meal causes a diner to gain 2d10 pounds. When the hag spies a properly-fattened victim, she steals the person away to a grim fate. /snakebite262]

13. **This tavern is run by a murderous devil swine.** This tavern has a reputation for debauchery, but few know that the owner is an evil lycanthrope. The devil swine eats one or more of the house's partiers nightly. Each day, the remains are butchered and fed back to the patrons. The staff of the tavern are cultists of the beast god, desperate to become devil swine themselves. /whpsh]

14. **This tavern facilitates communication with devilkin.** The special mead served here allows communication with devils. The imbiber appears to enter a drunken stupor, but is being contacted by extraplanar monsters. The tavern is run by a cult that uses the mead to receive instructions their master, a fiend. Cultists sometimes recommend the ""special mead"" to individuals they believe could prove useful for the devils. /Crepuscular_Animal]

15. **This tavern facilitates kidnappings from beyond.** The basement of this tavern contains a well leading into the Underdark, or a portal to another plane. The owners of the building have made arrangements with creatures from beyond their realm, allowing them access to enter the tavern during the night and steal whatever persons match their unfathomable tastes. /Crepuscular_Animal]

16. **This tavern is staffed by people possessed by ghosts.** A century ago, the family that ran this tavern all died in a fire. In time, their spirits came to possess living hosts, whom they have forced to rebuild their home and act out their former lives. Now the tavern is a successful business. However, the staff can sometimes be seen weeping for no reason, or staring blankly for minutes at a time. The hosts are still trapped within their bodies, desperate for escape. /Crepuscular_Animal]

17. **This tavern is the toy project of wealthy nobles.** All the workers in this establishment are nobles who cheerfully enjoy playing at labor, though much of the real work is done by servants. Some of the decisions and pricing are quirky, but it could be politically dangerous to criticize the “staff”. /gnurdette]

18. **This tavern exists in multiple places.** The clientele within this place is  highly diverse. While they all share the same space inside, when they leave, they exit back onto whatever street in whatever land they originated from. Because of this, it cannot be used as a form of travel, except by a special method known only to the mysterious, smiling tavernkeeper. /gnurdette]

19. **This tavern is a temple to a god of mead and revelry.** The tavern is staffed by a sect of gregarious priests who consider it their holy duty to provide alcohol without charge. They do, however, consider it a grave insult for those who imbibe to leave before becoming wildly intoxicated. /RevengerBadger]

20. **This tavern is a front for investigators.** A group dedicated to wiping out corruption built this tavern specifically to acquire evidence against nobles and government officials. The tavern is secretly staffed by retired law enforcement officers and journalists, and is replete with scrying devices and hidden observation chambers. Adventurers might be shooed away, or asked to aid in surveillance. /TimS1043]

21. **This tavern is also the entrance to a dungeon.** When the entrance to a vast dungeon was recently discovered, the owner of this tavern built his establishment right on top of it. Patrons can rent a room and load up on basic supplies before their delve. There is a fee to enter, but as customers are reminded, they get to keep whatever they find! /RyanTheLynch]

22. **This tavern is an intellectual hub.** This tavern is empty when the PCs arrive, but slowly begins to fill up with robed patrons. This is the favored watering hole of several prominent sages and scholars. This is a site of intense intellectual debate and discussion, and they will not tolerate rowdiness of any kind. /gnurdette]

23. **This tavern is serving tainted food.** There are clues about for anyone who is paying attention- the chef coughs when they call out to the watrons, a drunk is complaining about his stomach, and a few of the dishes seem off. It's an easily-avoided pitfall, but everyone eating here tonight is about to have a very unpleasant food poisoning experience. /gnurdette]

24. **This tavern is about to be attacked by the king's men.** A couple of hours ago, the prince and some of his friends, slumming incognito, picked a fight here and were badly beaten. The prince has dispatched a group of soldiers to take revenge on everyone in the tavern, and they are arriving soon. /gnurdette]

25. **This tavern is mounted on wheels.** This oddity of a tavern is a delight to many. It travels, slowly, all over the continent, the old-fashioned way: pulled by a large team of oxen. The wheeled undercarriage can be mistaken by patrons arriving at night, and the odd hitching post mounted to the building begins to make sense when you see the structure in motion. More than a few customers have fallen asleep in one town only to wake up en route to another. /gnurdette]

26. **This tavern is built around a hot spring.** The central area of this spacious tavern includes an open-air spring where bathers relax in a large pool. Inside, a smaller pool is used by the cooks for low-tech sous vide. Accommodations at this location are extravagant, with renown chefs, far-traveled sommeliers, talented bards, silk sheets, and prices to match. /gnurdette]

27. **This tavern is a demiplane.** The wealthy owner of this tavern hired a powerful wizard to move the building's interior into a demiplane. The outer structure is indeed in the town, but the door is a cleverly disguised portal, with illusion work here and there to keep patrons from getting suspicious. The bouncer at the door seems rather uptight about people not bringing in any portable holes or bags of holding. /Phoenix_667]

28. **This tavern is a weapon shop.** This isn’t a tavern at all — it’s a weapon store run by a civilized bugbear who speaks very limited common. The bugbear doesn’t understand the difference between “tavern” and “store”, and will ferociously argue with anyone who tries to inform them of their mistake. The locals quite enjoy the big shopkeep, and recommend that travelers go visit ""the best tavern in town!"" /RyanTheLynch]

29. **This tavern steals blood from its patrons.** This tavern is run by a wizard who sells blood to vampires. The wizard drains blood from sleeping guests and passed-out drunks but does not harm them in any other way. Certain drinks are spiked to ensure guests' memories remain foggy, but some of them find holes in their body or blood spots on their clothes. The food is delicious and accommodations comfortable, but a long stay can leave a guest pale, hollow and tired. /AutomatedChaos]

30. **This tavern IS a mimic.** This tavern can be found in a variety of locales, as it is alive. This mimic favors wooded areas and is a skilled woodworker... as it is necessary to repair itself after feeding. It is also a capable chef with a passion for knitting- it has spun all its own carpets with its own salivary silk. Someday, a resourceful adventurers might befriend the beast and have access to a moving tavern... /sonofabutch]

31. **This tavern inducts cultists.** The owner is this tavern is a high-ranking officer within a dark cult, and the function of this tavern is to recruit new members. The owner relies on both magic and keen insight to identify customers with the right predisposition to be indoctrinated in the organization. If threatened, the owner will pull a rope, ringing a bell that will summon reinforcements. /IMeMine_]

32. **This tavern hosts divine beings.** This tavern exists both in the mortal and divine realms. Though their true nature is cloaked, many of the patrons are gods in human form. Within these guises they test mortals with trials of worthiness, search for suitable prophets and champions, and give blessings to those who earn their sympathy. Many of the realm's demi-gods owe their conception to the tavern. /RevengerBadger]

33. **This tavern is a dragon's lair.** The walls of this tavern are covered in faded bounty posters, old royal edicts, pages from dated broadsheets, and shelves full of dusty knickknacks and memorabilia. The proprietor, unbeknownst to most, is a polymorphed dragon curious about the 'human' condition. The tavern hosts a range of events, from somber memorials to unbridled ribaldry, saving choice tokens to add to their hoard. While generally affable, woe betide the wayward soul that disturbs the dragon's collection of oddities. /Forsaken-Raven]

34. **This tavern is a stop for an subterranean railroad.** Every so often the peace of this quaint tavern is broken by a strange occurrence; the floor rumbles, there is a loud whistle, and the cellar door is flung open by a boisterous torrent of gnomes, dwarves, and other underground denizens, overburdened by luggage. Loudly complaining of their long journey, the passengers jostle furniture and patrons alike as they make their way out the front door. /Forsaken-Raven]

35. **This tavern hosts the 'Great Game'.** Within the main room of this tavern stands a large table, inlayed with a map of the world and covered in intricately carved tiles. Efficient servers laden with fine wines, exotic spirits, and rare delicacies pass through the hushed but enthusiastic crowd. Small fortunes are wagered in excited whispers as the enigmatic players take their turns. Upon closer inspection, some of the tiles bear striking resemblances to the adventurers. /Forsaken-Raven]

36. **This tavern is trapped in a time loop.** Unknown forces have trapped this tavern in a time loop. Everyone unfortunate enough to be present at that moment-the guests, the owner, his family and staff- experience the same events each day, though they do not perceive the loop. Their lives play out the same way every day unless acted upon by outsiders who happen to enter the tavern. /AutomatedChaos]

37. **This tavern is hosting a murder mystery.** Each week, the owners of this tavern act out a murder mystery. Devoted to verisimilitude, they no longer announce the game at the start. And because they utilize illusions to create the appearance of a real homicide, they frequently dupe unsuspecting guests. The tavern has attracted a class of patron who love puzzles and they do their best to play along in seeming ignorance. /AutomatedChaos]

38. **This tavern is in a feud with a neighboring one.** This tavern and the one next to it have been operated by the same ancient clans for hundreds of years, and the two clans have been embroiled in a feud for almost as long. Long ago, blood was spilt over their anger, but a betrothal between the families' young heirs has maintained the peace. These young people intend to find their own love elsewhere, opening the door for outsiders to somehow quell or exaggerate the conflict. /RevengerBadger]"

105,"1. **Hemomancy.** An offshoot of necromancy, hemomancy, or blood magic, focuses on using the caster's own life energy to empower their spells. The results are gruesome, but undeniably powerful.,
2. **Umbramancy.** An offshoot of illusion magic, umbramancy focuses on the manipulation of shadows and darkness. Though not inherently evil, the majority of umbramancers are thieves and assassins who use their talents to aid in their criminal endeavors.
3. **Radiomancy.** Directly opposed to umbramancy is radiomancy, the manipulation of light. As this school has a particular focus on radiant damage, it is favored by clerics and paladins for destroying unholy creatures such as fiends and undead.
4. **Acoustomancy.** The manipulation of sound, with a specific focus on thunder damage.

108,"When arriving at the village you ask the simple folk about the nearby castle. 

They lower their voices in fear and urge you to never go near the castle. The castle should be avoided at all times because...

1. ...a madness has struck the widow of the old Count and she has invited all kinds of dark and queer folk to her keep.

2. ...it has been abandoned since the great plague and noone has since spent the night there and returned.

3. ...it is in serious disrepair and its walls and roof are in a constant risk of collapse.

4. ...it has become the home of a secretive foreign alchemist and her odd servants. They doesn't bother the villagers but travellers have disapeared and strange sounds are sometimes heard.

5. ...the new baron is a brutal man who gained his position by murdering his good uncle. He is paranoid and sees plots against him everywhere. He has hired a lot of ruffians as his soldiers and taxes the people in an unlawful way in order to finance it.

6...the Mage has been experimenting with Wild Magic and spells pop off unintentionally and sporadically!

7...a Bulette has made that area its hunting ground!

8...it’s rumored that either a Doppleganger has replaced the Lord or a witch’s curse has beset upon him, for he acts completely out of character for the last fortnight!

9...the Captain of the Guard recently and quite mysteriously died and his replacement is extremely paranoid, throwing strangers into the dungeon for the slightest misstep!

10...it’s rumored that the Prince has succumbed to Lycanthrope and turned his entire entourage into were-creatures!"
109,"[

This post and Regill from Pathfinder - Wrath of the Righteous have made me rethink evil as possibly being simply defined 'selfish' and good as 'altruistic'. I'd be interested to see more examples of how this could pan out in a campaign without derailing it.

How would they think of themselves and how would that cause them to act? The character is goal oriented - which seems uncaring. They are efficient - which seems ruthless. They are probably relatively private? They probably disdain unnecessary acts of goodness - seeing them as weakness? Do they actively try to harm others for perverse reasons, with plausible deniability, or do they simply not care and view the world through a lens of extreme pragmatism?

Key words.

Efficiency. Goal oriented. Plausible deniability. Pragmatism. 'Cultural heritage'.

Examples:

1. The camp is under attack and there are precious seconds left to reach safety. They see soldiers struggling to carry the wounded to safety, being cut down because of this altruism. They order the murder of the remaining wounded to leave no choice but to flee for the safety of the caves.
2. The character's power source is dark and requires regular sacrifices. The character hides these from the party, tries to focus on 'deserving' sacrifices such as enemies, and they do a lot towards defeating the enemies of good (on their path to personal power, not caring if good or evil prevail).
3. You are quick to capitalise on disaster as a means to test your new invention/potion/spell. Oh no! The enemy is upon us! I must empower the villagers with this new magic.
4. Arsonist Red Mage. Joined the party for fun and freedom from pesky enforcement.
5. Lizardfolk druid/necromancer, who eats corpses of defeated enemies, and tries to convince others to do so as well, because it is part of their culture
6. Argue against the innocence of bystanders as an excuse to use them in dark rituals to further your power and influence.
7. A monk of Io who believes that any murder makes you an inherently evil person and since he committed murder then he is beyond redemption. So now he goes with the party to kill other violent people/creatures
8. Torturer. Works as a bounty hunter as an excuse to practice the art. No-one asks how he gets his information, and he doesn't volunteer the fact.
9. Necromancer. Actively put the undead to work in service of the living. Townsfolk love him. All he asks is that they hold their funerals on his land...
10. Nobleman forced by tradition or boredom into adventuring. Lawful Evil in that he knows his place, and the place of others around him.
11. Looter. You are with the party for the loot, for backstory reasons, rather than the cause of righteousness. You may go concerningly too far in 'helping'.
12. Knife-o-phile. You stab only who you're allowed to, within the limits that society tolerates; as often as you can.  [ 
13. The Good Strategy. Truly believes that good causes have mixed motives and really want power and wealth, He likewise will use this altruism strategy as it appears effective in building a movement and community, it doesn't mean he'll enjoy it or allow himself to make ""mistakes"" in the process. Everyone sacrifices a little to get what they want.
14. Religious Zealot. They read holy books and looks the part but grossly misinterprets them to justify evil deeds in the name of the religion. Externally is pious and devout, but internally uses cleverness and wit to get what they want. Witch hunts, Inquisitions, and tortuous exorcisms are their passion.
15. Lone Executioner. Doesn't believe in forgiveness, but in retribution for wrongs. Someone has to hold them accountable and it's going to be me. Even if the law won't allow for it or has nothing to do with me. I get to be the judge of that.
16. Bread Thieves. The group suffered from poverty and stole from certain accepted individuals to survive at an early age. This propels itself when they meet others in desperate need as well. ""The rich take enough from us, what's a little stealing going to do to provide bread on the tables for us and others?""
17. Nature preserver. The cities and towns are corrupt, tearing apart nature and the animals that live in it. They care only about themselves. I'm not going to stand around and allow them to flourish while I'm still alive. Someone has to keep the balance. Time to feed the soil with death, so nature can flourish.
18. A chaotic evil character who delights in the destruction the party causes, reigned in by the party who insists on unleashing this destruction only on those deserving.
19. A wizard seeking lichdom, insisting they take the soul of the party's very much human enemy (human in the sense that they're a mortal and fully of the Material Plane). 
20. There's the classic ""using evil to defeat evil"". You might be a piece of shit and an awful person for whole sale slaughtering a village and raising their corpses to fight, but the real evil is the incoming demon horde that plans on killing literally everything. What's one village in the face of the whole Material Plane?  [**Legaladvice420**](
21. Or one I really like for the whole playing an evil character in a good hero game - you can't rule the world if the whole world is dead. [**Legaladvice420**](
22. Oh, or you can be the scheming liar. You never personally held the knife that killed the king - but your lies wormed their way into the ears of his advisors, slowly twisting their perception of reality until the only clear choice to save the kingdom was to kill the king.  [**Legaladvice420**](
23. Cleric or follower of an evil God, but this evil God is under threat by the antagonist the rest if the party is fighting. Enemy of mye enemy is my riend after all
24. Or the God is already harmed or destroyed and now it is time for vengeance
25. Character is seeking fame as a hero, bit is only good when there is an audience. The goals to be remembered well after they die, becaus ethat's the closest they can reasonably get to immortality (liches get stitches)
26.  A wandering bard who is actually a spy for one of the planes of hell. They are friendly and charming to the party when encountered, but will sell any useful information to their hellish master in exchange for power down below.
27. A member of the party is an egomaniac who is trying to start his own cult. The rest of the party might not feel great about that, but the cultists are so very helpful...
28. The party are set upon by a murderous gang of halflings, and it just so happens that a member of the party had an irrational hatred of halflings
29. A necromancer desecrates a graveyard to raise zombies to protect the town he's in.
30. Charlatan Doctor offering new secret long life medicine to those on their death beds. Is actually a vampire.
31. Some kind of alchemist who has come up with novel uses for the body parts of magical creatures normally considered sacrosanct... But surely the life of any mere creature is worth less than that of a sapient? He doesn't actually need to kill unicorns, he just likes doing so.
32.  A female rogue/assassin who was taken as a child and sold into the sex slavery trade. After escaping has made a life’s mission of killing all men with no remorse. She is irredeemable and does not openly share her life’s goal with the other characters. She will continue to play along with the adventures while secretly exterminating all male NPCs as possible; particularly those nobles and higher classes.
33.  Warlock - has a patron that wishes to take over the world, subjugation, and all that jazz. As it turns out, an entirely different evil entity wants to do the exact same thing - and said other evil is going to beat the patron to the punch. The patron does *not* like this, so orders their minion to smash the evil. You may as well stick with the heroes to do that, right? Five or six is better then one.
34. Benevolent Tyrant. Will lead people into new age of prosperity and happiness, whether they like it or not. (Think Vetinari from Discworld)
35. &#x200B;
36. A bird. As in, play your character with the savagery and hubris of a bird.

111," I've gotten more into dungeon crawls lately. This is 5e based, but almost all of it is system-agnostic. Save DC's should be based off the level of the party, as should damage (I recommend the spell scroll chart in the DMG). Or no saves, that could be fun too.

112,"Looking to spice up my homebrew world and would love to add some fantasy weather to the mix. This could be as small as a different type of wind/rain, but I also want to add in some strange climates/biomes as well as large natural disasters that NPC’s fear.

1. Reverse Rain | Rain that moves from the ground up into the sky
2. Zero-Gravity Region | Creatures and objects freely float causing much chaos
3. Slime Volcano | A mountain that always threatens to erupt with sticky gooey slime
4. Plasma River | A dangerous river of fast-moving electrically charged particles
5. Space Cyclone | A twister that pulls things off the planet and into space
6. Oily Mist | While safe to breathe, this semi-toxic mist is quite flammable \[\]
7. Fighting Sunshine | An airborne plant pheromone activated by heat that reinvigorates you    \[\]
8. Sonic Downpour | A rain so intense, it makes communication more than 10 ft apart almost impossible \[\]
9. Ghost Fog | The line between this world and another is thin here, and sometimes things can be seen moving in the mist. Paranormal activity is at a high, and beings that expire within the fog have their souls corrupted \[\]  \[\]
10. Magnetic Storm | Electromagnetic pulses fill the air, metals become shocking to the touch, and anything relying on electricity could be damaged when used \[\]
11. Tamefire | A consistent fire that cycles through heavy woods. The fire doesn't catch on all plant life and rarely breaks beyond its borders, but when it does it goes wild. It's uncomfortably traversable (with breathing equipment) and is painted frequently \[\]
12. Snow Roll Plains | Snow particles here pull on one another and flow with the wind. This causes avalanches, but also forms cylindrical/spherical 'rolls' that move on their own. Sizes vary (some get up to 40 feet) and camping cannot be done safely with tents. Shelters require high walls and a sturdy exterior, causing smaller rolls to be used in construction \[\]
13. Gel Mat | After rainfall, something in the soil of these grasslands mixes with the water and is secreted out as a sulfurous-smelling clear gelatin. It can get up to 10 inches tall over days and evaporates over time. Heavy boots are a must, wheeled vehicles usually cannot make it through, and insects swarm the area in a feeding frenzy shortly after the rain \[\]
14. Sky Jelly Smack | A large group of glowing, floating jellyfish fills the night sky, feeding on other airborne life and attracting flying predators \[\]
15. Godfall | A god dies, warping the land around its corpse in a way that reflects its nature. Extradimensional scavengers come and feed on its remains, resulting in a unique ecosystem \[\]
16. Crimson Aurora | A vibrant aurora that has a curious effect on non-sapient animals, causing many of them to go into a frenzy \[\]
17. Energy mist | A strange fog that has little effect on living creatures but is capable of turbocharging magic and machines \[\]
18. Sword Rain | Swords rain down from the sky. Best stay inse for the day \[\]
19. The 13th Hour | Dark purple/magenta clouds drop crimson rain that spreads disease and makes creatures sick \[\]
20. Sharknado | Rare and dangerous, the sharknado is less effective on land, but is still deadly. It occasionally flings a random shark in a random direction \[\]
21. Breathable Liquid Biome | In this area, the water contains enough oxygen that land creatures can breathe it \[\]
22. Fire and Ice | This biome contains a mix of ice and sand. Tropical paradises mix with snow and hail to form a region of both hot and cold climate \[\]
23. Giant Biome | Everything is huge, as if travelers are the size of a mouse \[\]
24. Fungal Forest Biome | Mushrooms the size of trees, sometimes bioluminescent. Strange creatures roam, and residents take shelter within the mushrooms \[\]
25. Rapid Growth Biome | Plants grow from seeds to full-size in hours. They die after a few hours and then the cycle repeats \[\]
26. Spongy Biome | The land is made of a springy material. This causes everything that moves to bounce like its on a trampoline \[\]
27. Swarm | 1000s of creatures (bugs, reptiles, etc.) all hatch at the same time and cause chaos. Without shelter, you could be trampled...or worse \[\]
28. Acidic Rain/Fog | Dissolves any organic material it touches \[\]
29. Floating Island Birth/Death | A large section of land floats into the sky and begins to hover, causing the Earth to shake and tremble. This leaves a large chasm or crater in its wake. Eventually these floating islands can come crashing back down, causing even worse damage \[\]
30. Dimensional Colocation | A landmass from one dimension trades places with a landmass in another dimension, bringing with it any creatures, plants, and buildings \[\]
31. Dimensional Rift | A portal opens to another dimension. The atmosphere, creatures, or a hazardous substance begins pouring out \[\]
32. Eruption of Power | An insane amount of magical power flows upwards into the sky like a geyser. Any magic type causes this if enough coalesces at a single point, and the length of the event can vary from seconds to years \[\]
33. Wildstorm | A portal to the Feywild can become energized and release a mist-like storm into the material plane. The storm is invisible, and only shows itself through making everything in its area look like it's covered in shiny glitter. Any magic used from within the storm triggers a wild magic effect \[\]
34. Ghostfly Flight Night | Area becomes exceedingly haunted as ghostly flies take to the skies to reproduce, attracting bigger, equally ghostly predators. This isn't visible to the naked eye, so only indirect effects of this can be seen (migraines, things falling over, shivering, ghostly lights, etc.) \[\]
35. Prismatic Moon | The moon changes color at different times of the year and causes a variety of effects. Red causes undead to rise and hunt, orange causes fires to increase in size/power,  and yellow causes mass hysteria from terrifying hallucinations. Green causes massive plant growth and aggression, blue causes energy loss and sadness, and indigo causes the disappearance of random objects, people, and sometimes places. Violet Causes unpredictable magic effects/bursts, and a rare rainbow color causes all the effects to go off all at once. Most moons can be predicted in advance, but there is always a chance for a randomly horrific night \[\]
36. Wishful Shower | A seemingly normal meteor shower, but much larger in scale and beauty. One of the meteors is capable of making wishes come true, and this happens if a person says their wish while focusing on said meteor. This usually results in one or two lucky souls getting their wishes granted. In the past, nothing has happened, or entire kingdoms have collapsed from the wish \[\]
37. Light Rain | Dark and ominous clouds block the sky, foreshadowing a torrentious downpour. However, instead of water, beams of ethereal sunlight rain down. Some animals come out to reproduce during this, and many people see a Light Rain as a good omen \[\]

113,"Their are images people have in mind of PC race meals. Dwarves having meat, tough bread, and ale. Elves having leafy greens, fowl, and wine. Orcs having meat and more meat. But I thought, how about some more surprising meals. I am trying to avoid humans on this (we’d eat anything as a species, one guy in France ate an airplane). But here are a few I had thought of so far.

1. Wood Elves: deep fried moth pupa.

2. Dwarves: turnips. 

3. Orcs: tough shelled nuts like Brazil nut or black walnut they can crack with their tusks.

4. Gnomes: herb stuffed chipmunk

5. Halflings: edible tree leaves.

6. Hobgoblins - Befitting their militant nature, venison pemmican with hardtack and watered-down wine is a staple meal for them. Those who've had hobgoblin travel rations are often quite surprised by both the quality and the flavor. (MoonDew)

7. Halflings have religion advanced agriculture. They would have much less meat and more produce in their diet. Additionally they would be the only ones growing cocoa; sugar cane, and farming bees for honey. Halflings would rule the candy and sweets industry. (PantsIsDown)

8. Dwarves, having a resistance to poison, enjoy a greater variety of mushrooms and dishes with small hints of poison. Similar to how a shot of alcohol may kill some animals, how citrus is dangerous to cats, chocolate to dogs, etc. But we consume all those things

Something like Beef stewed with Death Cap Mushroom, Fish drizzled with a hint of snake venom, etc (DangerG1120)

9. Elves- fire ant juice used as hot sauce. Garum from mushrooms cultivated in the hollows of trees. (Salad-Burrito)

10. Halflings: This is not necessarily unexpected but it has to be said. Weed butter. (Salad-Burrito)

11. Tabaxi- silvervine bark cordial or syrup is used to enhance the taste and experience of a wide variety of cocktails and desserts. (Salad-Burrito)

12. Water genasi- the tentacles of a jellyfish bred to be non lethal. They find the sting to be tingly and pleasant. (Salad-Burrito)

13. Fire genasi- Fire resistance means they can enjoy food while its ablaze (constitution check). Lizard tails (they’ll grow back eventually) in sweet alcoholic sauce. On fire of course. (Salad-Burrito)

14. Air genasi- will carbonate beverages and soups by any means necessary, including fermentation, chemistry or magic. Carbonated sweet milk in a variety of flavors is a favorite among children. (Salad-Burrito)

15. Earth genasi- masters of pit barbecue. All animals can be cooked like lechon. Marinated juvenile mice cooked in the earth are a delicacy that must be mastered. A chef must really be in tune with the earth. Too long or too hot, and the meat will be dry. (Salad-Burrito)

16. Dragons: Tasting menus. Chefs who experiment with new flavors are a favorite collectors item among dragons who hoard new experiences. (Salad-Burrito)

17. Orcs- Absolutely love anything to do with honey. Honey drizzled on greens, honey-glazed meats, Mead, honey-dipped flatbread for dessert. Defeating an entire hive is considered one of the better tests of an orc warrior's endurance. (freakingfairy)

18. Dwarves- Traditionalists eschew newfangled imports like bread, beer, and beef for the far more traditional fare of cave crustaceans and blind fish caviar. A dwarvish seafood tower is the stuff of legends, even if it does glow under black light. (freakingfairy)

19. Elves- Despite commonly held misconceptions, elves are not fully vegetarian. Elves recognize that all humanoids are apex omnivorous predators and a diet in balance with nature includes some portion of game. Their closeness with nature does make meat a bit more of special occasion dish. You see, when an elf kills a living thing to eat, cultural taboos insist that every single last piece of it is used to the fullest extent. So, for every pound of meat, leather and carving bones there tends to be a pound or two of offal to take care of. Elven haggis is definitely an acquired taste, but you'll have plenty of chance to get used to it. Fortunately (depending on who you ask), the more modern generations have embraced solutions like sausage making and baking bits into pies and quiches. (freakingfairy)

20. Surprising? Orcs are vegan. (Japfro)

21. Gnomes: Artificial Goodberries (Snakebite262)

22. Gnoll: ""High meat""; Rotten meat partially preserved through certain spices and techniques. (Snakebite262)

23. Tabaxi: Spicey-Sweet Catnip Tea (Snakebite262)

24. Goblin: Gobbo Kimchi! (Snakebite262)

25. Kobolds: ""Dragon's Egg"" (A kobold's egg filled with a variety of strange plants and meat matter. It's rumored to allow a Kobold to evolve into a dragonborn or dragon.) (Snakebite262)

26. Gnoll preservation technique: kill bird, rip off feathers, taste, bake in sun while digging hole, bury, forget for two weeks, remember when smell becomes ripe, dig up, salt and pepper to taste, serve. (PantsIsDown)

27. Warforged: cannibalism.(Several_Citron_827)

28. Firbolg: goodberry cereal with almond milk. (Several_Citron_827)

29. Fairy: Sugar & honey coated sugar cubes. (Several_Citron_827)

30. Aarakokra: bugs cooked Cambodian street vendor style (DemonFire75)

31. Tieflings: bao buns, spicy stir fry and all manner of spicy Asian inspired foods (DemonFire75)

32. Drow: fried mushrooms, truffles and underdark root vegetables (DemonFire75)

33. Goliath: rich curry with rice to stay warm (DemonFire75)

34. Lizard folk: pickled EVERYTHING, it's the easiest way to preserve food after all (DemonFire75)

35. Dragonborn: an array of BBQ meats and kebabs (DemonFire75)

36. Lizard folk: Pickling is easy, but fermenting is even easier! Just let it spoil on the right way! (MossyPyrite)

37. Lizardfolk: cheese (ClairLestrange)

38. Tabaxi: a surprisingly varied diet of different jungle fruits, roasted insects and different meats, they also have quite the taste for sushi (ClairLestrange)

39. Tortle: also sushi. Especially if it's garnished with ginger and Wasabi. (ClairLestrange)

40. Tiefling: tea made from mineral-rich rocks (ClairLestrange)

41. Dwarves: root veggies cooked over a flat rock, sweetened with sugar beet syrup and served with hearty salted meat loaf (glinkenheimer)

42. Orcs: Cabbage leaf tea (CountMondays)

43. Goblins: Seventeen bean casserole (CountMondays)

44.  Elves: Fruit flavored cotton candy clouds (CountMondays)

45. Drow: Deep fried scorpion popcorn (CountMondays)

46. Dwarf: mountain goat cheese (CountMondays)

47. Halfling: Giant Roasted Pumpkin stuffed with cheese, bacon, rice, and tomatoes. (CountMondays)

48. Gnomes: Duck Egg soufflé with chives (CountMondays)

49. Dragonborn: Roasted hams with chili-pineapple glaze (CountMondays)

50. Tieflings: contract bread (salted Focassia bread that is eaten when a deal is struck) (CountMondays)

51. Kenku: blackbird pie (CountMondays)

52. Dwarves: goblin ear tacos (NecessaryCornflake7)

53. Orc: swampbug ice cream (NecessaryCornflake7)

54. Elves: kale and ant salad (NecessaryCornflake7)

55. Halflings: mole and ginseng stew (NecessaryCornflake7)

56. Aarakocra, like birds, are immune to capsaicin. They cultivate a wide variety of chilies and use them as a means of prolonging the shelf life of their food stores. Aarakocran rations are notorious for being inedible for any other species save for the most desperate of individuals. (Chibilatina)

57. warforged: a nuts and bolts salad with a lightly melted copper drizzle and a shot of motor oil on the side (Kionne8)

58. earth genasi: a cereal bowl filled with diamond flakes and a glass of (very) mineral water (Kionne8)

60. water genasi: a tall glass of river water, with a kelp salad on the side (Kionne8)

61. fire genasi: a dried leaves, herbs and charcoal salad with small chunks of wood bark (Kionne8)

62. Halflings: Bread stuffed with cheese & onion / Button mushrooms in savory herb sauce / Roasted goose with rosemary and garlic potatoes / Trout salad with mustard and cress / Strawberry wine / Pear and honey pie (murdercorn)

63. Dwarves: Toasted cheese on oatcakes / Pickled mackerel / Pork-turnip-potato pie / Barley and mushroom dumplings in bone broth / Brown ale / Sweet corncakes with honey (murdercorn)

64. Aquatic Elves: Seaweed bread / Shrimp and chili pepper rice / Carp marinated in cider, then boiled over a volcanic undersea vent (or over a fire), and finished with chili pepper cream, garnished with mint leaves, topped with a grilled oyster / Crispy salted fish skin chips / Green tea / Pickled mackerel (murdercorn)

65. High Elves: Almond bread with sheep butter / Trout poached in dill cream / Summer salad with herbs and hazelnuts / Roast parsnip with gorseflower honey / Honey ale / Yellow cake with wild cherries (murdercorn)

70. Lizardfolk: Believe it or not, alcoholic drinks. With all the berries growing in the swamp, along with wild swamp grass going to seed and making grains that can only be found there, some Lizardfolk have taken to fermenting the grain to make some of the weirdest, wildest booze. It could be amazing (wild raspberries, mulberries) to absolutely heinous (kelp, fish) so be warned.(Wabutan)"
114,"I'm currently homebrewing a Weird West style 5e campaign (my players were much more interested in Cowboys than High Fantasy). There are Were-animal-hybrids/zombies/mythical creatures and there are plenty of Supernatural elements. But no races other than humans. Magic users exist but aren't particularly common and aren't socially accepted by most common people.

I've got a d100 encounter table that is about half full and I'm out of ideas/things to rip off. I need a good mixture of regular Wild West encounters and supernatural Weird West encounters.

The campaign isn't going to be super serious, so feel free to get as silly or 'punny' as you like. But some dark, grizzly, downright spooky/evil ideas are greatly appreciated too.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

This is what I have so far (Some of this was stolen from old reddit threads so I apologize that there is no credit to the users who came up with some of these):

1. While walking down the road, the heroes see a pair of disembodied legs walk up to them, invisible hands try to riffle through their pockets and belongings. if confronted, the would-be thief admits that he thought he was fully invisible and that the potion that snake oil salesman sold him must have been watered down.

2. A pair of thieves in a secluded spot near the road are loudly arguing how to they are going to split the money while are trying to open a stolen safe with a stick of dynamite and, unless intervened, will neglect to distance themselves from the explosion. killing them both but leaving the safe open, with its contents intact 

3. The party is traveling between towns on a dusty road. It's nearing dusk, and the party is getting ready to hunker down when suddenly they hear the thundering of hooves! They look around but can't find the telltale dust cloud of whatever person(s) or beast(s) are making the noise. The sounds of the many hooves grow louder, and with them come the sounds of wranglers, tippy ki yaying and yippy ki ohhing, but still no sign of any herd or riders. Coincidentally one looks up and gasps, ""Ghost Riders! Ghost Riders in the sky!""

4. An undead stranger enters a saloon, and challenges one patron to drink or draw, i.e. match the revenant drink for drink, or match him in a gunfight. The stranger explains he was hung for killing a man who stole his beer. He was cursed to wander, challenging someone every night. If someone outdrinks him, he can rest. Otherwise, he challenges them to pistols at noon. This revenant must lose one of these contests to find rest.

5. You see an outlaw you recognize from a wanted poster. should you pursue them a thrilling chase ensues. when you capture the outlaw, they reveal themselves to be a face-changer who acts as a decoy for the real outlaws (or they do it for the thrill of outrunning bounty hunters).

6. Mamaw Kettle, a cigar smokin' gang matriarch, and her brood, The Kettle Boys, have rigged a bridge to blow. They're demanding tribute to cross safely.

7. The party comes upon a shipwreck. Far far inland.

8. A lone stranger, clad in trench coat and ten-gallon hat, stands in the middle of the road with the sun at his back. he stops the party saying “Now, how’s about you hand over any yer valuables.” If the party refuses, a pair of draconic wings block out the setting sun as they unfurl from his back. “I wasn’t askin”. He has entered a symbiotic relationship with the manitou he lost to and willingly allows it to possess him indefinitely. The party can fight him, hand their belongings over, or, with the right Persuasion roll (DC 18) convince him to let them join him in a spot of thievin’ and lootin’

9. Carnivorous tumbleweeds biting at the party's ankles.

10. A cowboy is accused of cheating at cards and is forced to defend himself. He kills his accuser, who is the son of the richest man in town, and is rounded up by a posse who doesn't care that it was self-defense.

11. A man from a remote village or settlement has gone missing - local elders believe him to be possessed by a Wendigo.

12. A ritualistic shaman invites the party on a ""spirit quest"" - which involves ingesting psychedelic cacti and viewing things that may come to pass. 

13. A local bandit leader shows up in town, calling out the local sheriff/marshal/lawman to face him.

14. A crew of prisoners condemned to railroad construction duty have escaped, taking the company's blasting munitions along with them.

15. People warn not to go in to the towns graveyard at night, as it is haunted by the undead. The townsfolk leave there dead at the borders of the graveyard, as they think it is the only thing keeping the undead at bay. When night comes, a thick mist roles over the tombstones obscuring everything from the knee down. Wandering the graveyard is a shovel wielding skeleton, dressed in dirty, torn clothes. The skeleton is not hostile, and instead it wanders the graveyard digging and burying the dead. The skeleton is the only undead creature in the graveyard.

16. The sheriff asks the adventurers to accompany a farm hand back home. He came to town the night before, talking about a large, dead looking tree with a number of nooses hanging off its branches. It appeared not too far from the farm one night, and got closer each night since. He was sent to town to fetch some help. When the group returns with him, they find the place abandoned. After some investigation they find five people hanging from the tree in the center of the farm.

17. As they’re travelling the group there’s someone shouting for help. In the distance, someone is perched atop a rock with three creatures (TBD) angrily standing around the rock trying to get to them. Their horse is dead and laying on the ground in front of the rock. They can’t offer much, but they do have a map that is meant to lead to a buried treasure not too far from here.

18. While travelling at night, the group stumbles upon a still burning campfire in the distance. When they arrive at the fire, there are a number of dots available for them, with one extra. If they stay at the fire for longer than an hour, a stranger approaches in a trench coat, the brim of his hat sat low. He greets the group in a friendly manner, before lifting his hat to reveal his glowing gold eyes.

19. While travelling, the group here’s a shout from somewhere nearby. Upon quick investigation, they realize that not too far away their is a tall, but scrawny prospector with his head sticking out of a hole in the ground. He is surrounded by holes in the ground, and covered in dirt, and with a bandana wrapped around his face he makes for a strange sight. With an eccentric personality and speech, I’m he asks for help to find and dig up the treasure that he is sure is in the area (happy to split it 50/50 with the group). A quick glance at the map shows he is in the completely wrong spot, but someone in the party remembers a landmark on the map was only a few miles back.

20. At night in an abandoned and completely run down ghost town, lingering spirits wander around mournfully trying to perform the actions they would have in life. The spirits try to speak with and involve people on their activities, as if they were still alive, but they don’t act in a hostile manner unless provoked. In the base of the run down mansion, when searched through, there is a small jade idol with gold details, carved to look like a skull. If someone takes it, they hear echoing wails from outside as the ghosts become aggressive specters.

21. A limping coyote approaches the campfire, bowing its head and acting in a frightened manner. If the group acts in a hostile way it flees, but if not it approaches the friendliest character and tries curl up next to them and rest. When everyone goes to sleep, whoever is on watch or guard for the night here’s something behind them, but when they turn they are overcome with drowsiness and fall asleep. In the meowing when they wake, wealth and magic items are missing with human tracks that turn in to coyote tracks leading from the camp sight.

22. A dwarf with a large curled moustache and no hair sets up a small travelling store pulled by a short donkey. The store has the imagery of a snake in a bottle as it’s simple, and he offers a range of specialized potions and tonics, all of which have a serpent theme. Though they seem to work at first, they all have a draw back.

23. A stranger wanders in to town keeping to herself, and taking a seat at the corner of the bar. After an adventure partakes in a gambling activity, she joins in shortly after , but still keeping to herself. After winning a few rounds, she asks the adventurer/s if they’d like to make a bet for something “a bit more interesting”, staying deliberately ambiguous about what she offers. If they agree, her eye’s glow with a pale blue light and a smile breaks across her lips stretching to an unnaturally wide amount.

24. Late in the night, the party hears shouting and singing. Should they investigate, the find a group of Native American. They are friendly and offer the PCs a smoke from an ornately carved pipe. If a PC accepts, they must make a DC 16 con save. On a success, they gain a glimpse into tomorrow’s events, gaining one use of the Divination wizards portent ability. On a failed save they are rendered incapacitated for 1d6 + 1 hours while they vividly hallucinate.

25. A fur clad Bounty Hunter is setting an elaborate trap for a feather-wearing Outlaw who is addicted to speed-potions. His traps spectacularly backfires and he asks the party for some 'more practical' assistance.

26. A man calls out for help, buried to his neck in the sand. He offers a reward if you dig him up. But you won't have far to dig, for his neck ends in a bloody stump. The head is still very much alive after being picked up.

27. A seriously malignant corpse. Mortal wounds from a multitude of weapons, glyphs carved on body parts possibly indicative of some energy center or sacred anatomy, and a flock of dead buzzards who tried to eat him and died for it. Sticking around leads to nothing good.

28. A spirit known as the Starin' Nightwatch, who is said to guard an abandoned town.

29. Bernadine Fitzgerald, owner of the Light Canary Inn, who is friendly to guests and offers the party a room for the night. Rumors say that she kills discourteous guests and bakes them into meat pies.

30. A giant monster has demolished a ranch. Debris and bodies are scattered everywhere. The monster turns out to be a giant bull. The ranchers were experimenting with (alchemy, dark magic) to increase the size of their cattle, so they could increase their profits.

31. 2 gunfighters get in a duel in the middle of town. They walk 20 paces turn and shoot. They shoot again. Turns out they were both turned into zombies before the duel. They aren't quite sure how to settle their disagreement since the standard duel will no longer work.

32. An isolated gallows with 2 zombies wriggling on the end of their nooses.

33. A widow by the name of Martha Belle is wanted DEAD or ALIVE for the many murders of lone men, she is very manipulative and seems to own magic.

34. Sirens at an Oasis luring people to their deaths through song. The Oasis requires daily sacrifices or it will dry up entirely.

35. Mimic Outhouse eating people who attempt to ""do their business"" in it.

36. Drunk men on their way home from the tavern are being mugged every night by a gang of rolling pin and switchblade wielding grannies. (Party must be at least mostly intoxicated)

37. Quicksand Elemental luring the party into a trap with a hypnotic angler lure.

38. Zombie Bandits that demand your brains and ""will let you pass safely"" if you give them up.

39. A large arrow is sticking firmly out of the ground directly in front of you. It happens again for the next several days.

40. A dandy lawyer from back east looking to hire some experienced gun hands with a lack of morals to engineer an 'accident' that he will profit greatly from. The target is a child who stands to inherit a large sum of money.

41. A stage coach guard struggles to carry two large bags marked U.S. Mail to the post office inside the general store. He complains loudly about the ""railroad and the Chinese stealing his job and ruining America"".

42. A well-dressed gentleman walks up to you and asks if you know where he might find an experienced gunsmith. He needs some extremely custom ammunition made; he is unwilling to say more.
43. A charlatan of the worse sort has rolled into town with a Fakir act and a scam to con grieving widows and widowers out of their money. The false mystic claims to be able to communicate with the dead and, IN RARE CASES, restore them as they were.

44. A bounty hunter on the trail of a grizzly bear that mauled and dragged off the bounty that she was chasing. Now she figures the bear's cave might have remains or items that can help her claim the dead money for the bounty.

45. Near nightfall the group comes across a camp with a fire, a large tent, various supplies, and two horses. Alone in the tent and sleeping is a wildlife photographer who is gathering pictures of various legendary and mythical creatures. She is currently ""hunting"" the Jersey Devil.

46. Spring-heeled Jack is harassing the unassuming townsfolk at night and jumping away before anyone else can see him.

47. You come across 4 cowboys (5 cowboys) sitting by a fire, telling stories and putting on shows for each other. If you insult any of their shows, they will threaten to ""kill/shoot you and wear your boots."" The neglected 5th cowboy may take the party's side in hostilities if the party simply acknowledges his existence in a non-negative way. (WKUK)

48. A local has recently purchased a depleted Silver Mine. Has the idea of turning it into a Tourist Attraction or perhaps a Haunted Tour. But they need someone to go in first to look the place over. Get rid of any residents that have taken up living there.

49. Two Farmers are having a dispute regarding water rights. One says they're free to dam the river since they live upstream and thus have ownership. The other has more land and depends on the river flowing.

52. The party comes upon a destroyed caravan transporting goods. The lone survvor of the attack is on top of a large rock about 20 yards away and warns the party to ""get off of the sand"" as fast as they possibly can. (Tremors)

53. Abnormal creatures sought for vital scientific research. Doctor Theophillius, late of the The Ohayee State University, is offering cash payment for unique specimens, living or dead, as well as for human volunteers.  \[Note: Any character with appropriate background can roll to know that ""Doctor"" Theophillius was asked to leave MIT under questionable circumstances involving vivisection of the local transient population\].

54. A sharpshooter approaches the party and offers to pay one of them handsomely if they will let him demonstrate his skills in a 'William Tell' game (The player must let the sharpshooter shoot an apple off of their head to receive an award)

55. The same mysterious scarecrow appears in fields near the party. No farmer, in any of the fields, has any recollection of putting it there. And it will be gone if it leaves the party's line of sight.

56. Bounty: The Dust Devil - Trademark: Yells ""pocket sand!"" and chucks a handful of dust or salt into your eyes before robbing you.

57. The party comes upon a mysterious farmhouse that was never previously there. Upon closer inspection the mirage/façade fades away to reveal a broken down alien ship. A lone surviving alien is attempting repairs. He does not speak English but can communicate emotions telepathically. He is not inherently hostile to the party unless provoked but drops an alien pistol that can be fired 8 times before it is rendered useless.

58. A 15-foot-long rattlesnake with wish-granting magic bite, guarding a mysterious lever. (Are there clues hinting that the snake grants wishes? Is the lever a big red herring and being bitten is the best outcome?)

59. A man experimenting with magic and technology has managed to animate his automobile. Unfortunately, it has taken it upon itself to kill anyone who wrongs it's owner. The owner no longer want the car to be animated but cannot stop it himself.

60. A mysterious old man is selling wares from his stand. He offers the party a striped Jackalope and warns the party not to feed it after midnight. His stall is gone the next day and he is never seen again. If his instructions are not followed, the jackalope will undergo a monstrous transformation and spawn multiple transformed jackalopes.

61. An old, blind bounty hunter with Daredevil-like perception mistakes the party for the band of outlaws he has been pursuing due to their similar odor. (Maybe the bandits switched their identical duster jackets with the party to hide their scent?)

62. The party is challenged to a duel by a naked man wanting to test out the ""bulletproof armor"" he just bought from a traveling salesman. (You can roll to see if he is actually wearing some sort of invisible bulletproof armor or whether he has just been swindled)

63. The party encounters a charismatic man wishing to celebrate some great accomplishment. He spends the evening ""buying"" the party drinks, only to skip out and leave the party with the bill.

64. You come across a dead, masked Ohayee Ranger, with a gunbelt full of silver bullets. He was clearly mauled by a giant wolf. This leads to an adventure tracking down a group of werewolf bandits.

A sign appears on the door of the saloon promising it will open the next night under new management. The new management is evasive about his whereabouts or the terms of the deal and are generally quite suspicious about the whole thing.

67. A local news rag runs a print on a creature that killed a local trapper in a manner no beast every could have, it then attacked a family farm. A reward is being offered for the creature, even though nobody fully believes the fantastical description of the creature by the family farmer. Assuming the party go out for the reward and hunt the creature they find the trail leads to a nearby cave where a manner of items are stored to make a man look like a monster. There a local rival farmer can be found, he was just trying to scare off the family farmer and take his land. The man claims to have no affiliation with the death of the trapper - So what then killed the trapper?

68. A Sasquatch approaches the party's camp in the woods and drops a huge gold nugget in their midst. Hunters killed Bigfoot's boy and he wants the PCs to track down the lawless varmints and pay them back.

69. The party finds a ghostly pair of armies dueling eternally every full moon. They just need to get one side to surrender to put all of the spirits to rest.

70. The party finds a naked man, horribly sunburned in the desert and hopefully bring him back to civilization. He was robbed in the middle of the desert and left for dead.

1. A pirate ship with all of it's crew are heavily asleep. Waking up any of the crew members causes them to suffer a heart attack! Further inspection of the ship reveals that someone brought aboard a cursed gem in the shape of a skull! Dispelling the magic from the gem will safely wake all of the crew.
2. An island with a sail hung from palm tree's pulls up next to you! On it you see a man with tattered clothes and an age old beard. It's a traveling merchant! Right now it doesn't look like he has many goods, but he sure has a lot of money! All of his goods are laid out neatly on a very tattered, red and white checker blanket. The trader will buy pretty much anything; don't try to steal from him though. His island and goods are protected by coconuts shrouded in blue flames, haunted by the souls who were lost at sea!

10. A whirlpool appears outside of your adjustable course. If  the ship is sucked in the current propels you to the bottom of the ocean. Any crew members that are not secured will be found later eating grapes on the beach fed to them by mermaids while the rest of the crew struggles to escape.
11. You find flotsam drifting around your ship destroyed ships from a concluded battle.

13. A natural archway of seemingly natural stone that, if travelled through, leads to an ocean of blood within a demonic dimension.
14. A merchant ship filled with riches that looks to just be floating about on its own. It is completely abandoned. What kind of horrors/madness would cause the entirety of the crew to abandon such wealth? Why is there no trace of the crew at all, or any discernible struggle?
15. A massive Storm Giant that is just sitting atop a sand bar. He is fishing using a God Sized fishing rod. What is he fishing for you ask? Krakens hopefully. He wishes to make a nice Kraken dish for his girl for their anniversary. Unfortunately he seems to only be catching Colossal Squid thus far.
16. A dead whale that is just floating around and bloating from the trapped gasses within. Don't poke it. Oh dear, there are sharks poking it. Yup they're taking chunks out of it. Its gonna explode if they keep biting it. Yeah- yup and there it goes. It exploded.
17. Trillions upon trillions of ants have, it seems, connected themselves together in a lattice and have formed a successful raft. By the grace of the gods, and the laws of physics they are floating to new lands. Take your hats off and salute these ants, friends, for their own unfathomable goals are loftier than our own and yet they are showing the world they can achieve anything. Respect.
18. Amidst the waves, there is a strange section of the ocean that all of a sudden features completely still and undisturbed water. Very suspicious.
19. A meteor from space, probably a solid 100 feet in radius, lights up the sky in a blaze and contacts the surface of the water sending a massive geyser back up into space and showering the surrounding mile and a rainy mist. It contacted the water nearly a mile away, will you investigate? Is it lost to the depths or did it land in a shallow enough spot to dive to?
20. 3 lights can be seen a few miles away dancing above the ocean. Once the party's craft gets closer the lights suddenly rush towards them. They're pixies, and they're a little worse for wear. They plead for the party to save their island home from ""the rock man"".

30. Pirate ship with (enter monster here) as the captain
31. A vast algae bloom that's deprived local wildlife of oxygen so drastically that the fish and plants have all died. Sort of like a desert on the ocean.
32. A hot air balloon is floating along the breeze. The sole occupant of the balloons basket, a middle-aged male halfling, seems to frantically trying to land the balloon on the deck of your ship. Do you allow it ? or do you shoot him down?

39. A barrel bobs along the waves. Inside, wrapped in multiple layers of different material, are several small books describing the adventures of 'forgotten heroes' (stories from previous campaigns, the plots from famous movies, fairy tales with all the names changed etc). One book however appears blank inside spare a picture of the moon. If read in moonlight, the reader will learn a spell.
40. A rowboat occupied by three famished and guilt-ridden seamen together with the well-gnawed bones of the deceased Cabin Boy, young Master Richard Parker, 17 y/o, destined not to grow any older.
41. A long makeshift canoe manned with goblins is anchored. The goblins are slapping the water with broad oars in unison, creating waves. When asked what they are doing, they say they are creating a tsunami to punish another beach-dwelling tribe who insulted their leader.
42. An awe-inspiring school of glittering flying fish burst from the ocean around you, chittering with delight like a beautiful birdsong.
43. From far off you see storm clouds, approaching fast. As the storm comes nearer, a water spout forms, stretching from the ocean to the sky. What are those large shapes swirling within the spout? Surely those aren't triangular dorsal fins?!""
44. You've been stuck in the doldrums for a few days now, wishing for something, anything, to happen. As that thought crosses your mind for the thousandth time, a smell catches your nose. It smells like low tide in the docks. A desiccated hand, seaweed clinging to it like funeral wrappings, claws its way onto the rail. The arm attached to it, and yes truly the entire clawing corpse, is similarly encased in seaweed. Two more seaweed mummies quickly join it, effortlessly clawing their way onto the deck. A scream from elsewhere on the boat makes you realize that maybe you should have been careful what you wished for...
45. Off the stern you see men approaching the boat. Each is standing astride two harnessed sharks and it's hard to mistake the malice in their eyes.
46. Another gout of flame lights up the night sky. Truly this must be the terrible one-winged dragon pirate, Captain Blauvint with his magical cannon Belcher.
47. A boxy black ship that runs with no lights at night. It's a floating ninja fortress!

51. A small jungle island inhabited solely by dinosaurs, though crumbling structures hint at a previous civilization.
52. *Vampirates. Nuff said.*
53. *A woman frozen in a solid block of ice, just bobbing there in the ocean. She looks mildly annoyed.*
54. A mile wide iceberg floats nearby, inhabited by a young white dragon and his cohort of kobold fishermen. There are several penguins​ that will raise the alarm should any Interlopers appear. The white dragon waits in a cave at the center of the burg and uses ice shape to ensure victory if anyone is foolish enough to face him within. He is visible through the ice. Sloped Icy staircase: DC-23.
55. At night, preferably, the sound of oars. Light reveals a black shape: a hooded man in an old boat; he asks for food and if given, he returns to a little isle somewhere close. If searched, the isle, the man and her wife, are infested with fungi.
56. *The party comes across an unexplained abandoned ship floating on the high seas (a la the Mary Celeste. Exploring the craft is a disturbing experience - the PC's continually see things moving out of the corner of their eye.*If they look in the captain's cabin they will find what appears to be a large chest. Alas, it is a mimic. The party will then realize the things they saw moving in the corner of their eyes are more of the creatures: the ship is infested with mimics! What has happened here? Here are some possibilities:● 1: The ship was transporting captured mimics, and they escaped and ate the crew.● 2: Mimics are squid like creatures native to the depths of the sea. Every so often they come to the surface - perhaps to play, breed, or hunt.● 3: The mimics are the spawn of a much larger mimic... the ship itself.
57. A ship infested with [rum gremlins]( \-- they're contagious!
58. An uncharted island with a line mountain and lots of vegetation. It appears to move . . . And it opened an eye? The island is a giant turtle. And there's a druid grove/tower/ruins on its back.

63. Your Mage/scientist inspects a rainbow shimmer on the surface of the water surrounding your ship, it's liquid memory holding a message/warning.
64. A ship is sighted, called ""Esoteric Order"" from the city of Newburyport. The first seaman seen, Obed Marsh, seems normal, and responds to overtures. He tells them that...*""Right naow Cap'n is abaout changed. Can't shet his eyes no more, an' is all aout o' shape. He still wears clothes, but he'll take to the water soon.""*Once closer, the PCs will see that the ship is crewed by silent, squat men with bulging eyes that never blink. When hailed, they simply stare at the PCs with unblinking eyes and gaping mouths. A rank stench of dead fish and rotting seaweed hangs over all. Swimming in the water beneath the ""Esoteric Order"" are humanoid shapes...

66. There's a small, rocky island far away from any other land. On it is a very attractive woman in a makeshift shelter. You can hear her singing long before you can see her. She is NOT a siren; she is a bard whose performance is singing. She is here due to a miscalibration of a teleportation circle. She's also chaotic evil, greedy and very charming.
67. Giant Piranhas surround the ship.

118,"Based upon the Folding Halls of Halas from Critical Role. Labyrinth was made by an archmage as both a domain to live and research in, and a trap for those coming to steal from him. Each room is either something of interest to a powerful wizard, a trap, or guarded by monsters. If not all of the above. Secret portals and pathways connect one room to the next.

1. **The Tapestry Room** A variety of tapestries hang from the walls. Most are completely mundane. Some have doors behind them. One is a Rug of Smothering infested with Yellow Mold.

2. **The Dollhouse** On the surface, appears to be a standard house. But everything inside is made of painted wood. If anyone touches the large metal latch on the wall, the entire house splits and opens like a dollhouse, revealing a gaping void. Obviously, also contains animated, people sized dolls.

3. **The Playroom** Resembles a child's play room, complete with a toy chest and puppet stage. Puppets appear from behind the curtain and interrogate the party upon what they are doing. The puppets are performed by a Beholder who is hiding behind the stage. The Beholder attacks if the party admits to being intruders, or if they try to steal from the room.

4. **The Cursed Collection** Simply a room full of cursed items.

5. **The Trophy Room** A room full of taxidermized D&D monsters. Owlbear, Gryphon, stuff like that. Some probably animate and attack.

6. **The Menagerie of Slime** Glass tanks containing a variety of different oozes, slimes, and jellies. The tank containing the Elder Oblex as a small crack in it. The Oblex attempts to lure the party into the Menagerie room, and missed attacks have a chance to damage other tanks.

7. **The Completely White Void Containing a Single Black Dot** Appears to be an empty white void with a two-foot-diameter sphere floating in the middle. Attempting to walk in the opposite direction of the sphere reveals the room to actually have walls, and with a high enough investigation or perception check, doors. The sphere is a Sphere of Annihilation. If controlled and moved through one of the doors of the room, the room is destroyed and everyone inside is teleported to a random room.

8. **The Sentient Armory** A collection of sentient weapons and armor. The armory itself is also sentient, and it does not approve of intruders.

9. **The Mirror** A Mirror of Life Trapping, containing a mix of dangerous monsters, and former intruders. Put it in a hall of mirrors, if you want to be an asshole.

10. **The Ghost Aisles** A haunted library, stalked by Allips.

11. **The Balcony** A normal sitting room with large windows along one wall. Glass doors open out onto a spacious balcony that seems to be floating in the Astral Sea. When viewed from the outside, the door, windows, and balcony appear to be floating untethered in the void, though another similar balcony floats directly beneath the. The glass is thick and heavily enchanted, making the windows extremely difficult to break. The keys to the balcony are hanging on a hook next to the non-balcony entrance. The keys also unlock the lower balcony doors, which lead to another room.

12. **The Invisible Cell** Resembling a castle dungeon, this room is made of cobblestone and lit by mounted torches. Arcane implements and books are scattered over a makeshift workstation. In the center of the room is an attractive humanoid in fine attire. Attempting to get within thirty feet of the center of the room is prevented by an invisible wall. The humanoid is actually a disguised Rakshasa, who will attempt to entice the party into freeing them utilizing the books and implements available. The Rakshasa wants their freedom, but is also greedy and vengeful. They will betray the party as soon as they see an advantage in doing so.

13. **The Pink Dragon** This large cavern is covered in two things. Treasure, and gunk of varying viscosity, ranging from pink to dark grey. The entire room has a sickeningly sweet smell. Sleeping upon the largest pile of treasure is a Pink Dragon. In addition to physical attacks, the dragon can spit up wads of pink, encompassing gum, or blow bubbles and burst them to deal Thunder damage. Moving across pink gunk is difficult terrain, as it sticks to your feet and slows your progress. Grey gunk isn't sticky, but treasure sitting in it is adhered in place.

14. **The Simulation Chamber** At first blush, this room appears to be empty save for a large tome sitting upon a lectern. Opening the tome to any page creates a powerful opponent, and a suitably sized and themed battlefield. Opponents may include a Tarrasque, a Solar, a Pit Fiend, a Kraken, or other similarly powerful foes. These opponents attack upon noticing any living creature, and though illusionary, they deal real damage. Should at any point one of these opponents cause a creature to accumulate three or more failed death saves, that creature stabilizes instead and becomes immune to all damage until they regain at least 1 hp. If ever the opponent, or all living creatures on the field, are reduced to 0 hp, the opponent and battlefield disappear. The tome room only has one entrance/exit, but it leads to different rooms depending upon which opponent is selected. If all living creatures leave the room, the simulation ends.

15. **The Sculpture Gallery** Dozens of stone humanoids are on display across a number of spacious, opulent chambers. Curiously, it appears that someone is in the process of painting them all, with some being works in progress while others are fully detailed. The postures and poses of the sculptures vary, but all share the same horrified expression. Though they never move, you can't escape the feeling that you are being watched. (This room connects to the Playroom)

16. **Maze of Sand** The entrance to this area vanishes once you have traversed it. You find yourself in a maze, the walls of which are composed of Walls of Sand. The walls shift and move, attempting to separate the party and/or lead them into pit traps, Dust Devils, and exits to more dangerous rooms. If someone blindly pushes through the maze walls in a single direction, they will eventually find themselves on the outside of the maze near a door to a safer location.

17. **Storage Room** Piles of outdated and busted furniture collecting dust. Was that chair covered in a drop cloth there before? It wasn't. It's a mimic that was napping is now stalking the players.

18. **Wine Cellar** A room full of rare vintages. Wooden casks large enough to swim in lay on their sides against the walls, while rows of shelves split the room into three aisles. Selecting the wrong bottles will cause Wine Elementals se Water Elemental block) to pour out of the casks and attack. Selecting the correct bottle causes the front of one of the casks to swing open, revealing a secret exit to the room.

19. **Potion Laboratory** While previously a place to brew and store potions, this room has seen better times. An upended cauldron lays in the center of the room, spilling its contents across the floor. Shelves that previously stood against the walls have been knocked over, shattering bottles and soiling ingredients. Additionally, a bloodied corpse lays crumpled and prone near the cauldron. Upon getting too near the cauldron, the spilled potion begins to coalesce into a Botched Potion Ooze. Using the cauldron like a snail shell, it has much higher armor class than an ooze typically would, and it has the ability of whichever potion the alchemist was originally intending to brew.

120,"A merfolk civilization, a political faction, a religious group, a cult, etc. think one of the PCs, or the group of PCs, fulfil an important prophecy or legend. They've been waiting for this moment for a long time but the candidate must pass the trials and challenges first. Only the prophesized one can succeed.

One of the PCs in my game is a potential candidate for fulfilling a prophecy. A merfolk princess was kidnapped as a child and cursed to forget their past and appear different. The merfolk think she could be the princess, but now they must prove it.

1.	One thousand mundane items are placed in front of the PC and they must pick the three items that feel/seem important to them - *there is only one right answer*.
2.	An artifact is embedded in stone. It has never been removed for only the prophesized one can remove it. The PC must remove the artifact from the stone.
3.	A magical pool, or well, exists such that everyone who drinks from it dies instantly except for the prophesized one. The PC must drink it and survive.

11. Retrieve a stolen artifact from a [insert relevant creature]. 
12. Recover a lost artifact from a location only the prophesized one could find.
13. Activate a powerful artifact. It will only activate for the prophesied one.

14. Open the door that cannot be opened. No one thus far has been able to open it and no force thus far has been able to scratch it.
15. Pass through a magical barrier. It was designed so that only the prophesied one can pass through it.
16. Read the sacred text (book, scroll, tablet). It is written in a language not of this world, only those from the prophesied one's home world can read it.
17. The prophesied one must be able to pull the sacred object into reality from an ethereal bubble. The object can be seen, but everyone else just passes through it like it's not really there.
18. The prophesied one must return from the dead (or what appears to be death).

20. The chosen one must visit a sacred grove. If they are worthy, the spirit of the grove will appear to them.

39. Follow the high priest on his nightly trek. Perhaps it could be a difficult or dangerous walk (steep mountain side, small rock pillars above white water rapids). A path that would otherwise require a decade of practice and learning.

122,"Looking to make a list of dark curses. No objects in this list, but I might make another list for that! Please nothing silly. Just dark, grim, strange, or ghastly. Thanks!

Loving all of your ideas!

Marking NSFW just in case!

1. Hom-Dai (From The Mummy 1999): Curse to punish the worst blasphemers that committed severe crimes. The victim is condemned to a cursed life that would not end, even in death. Their body may be physically dead, but their spirit/soul/etc is unable to rest. If the victim should ever arise, it would bring forth plagues, condemning the victim to be a spreader of pestilence. \[Prepared by cutting the victim's tongue out. Then mummified alive (with flesh-eating scarabs as an option)\]
2. Kom Abou-Billou (Egyptian Tomb): All people who enter this tomb, make evil against this tomb and destroy it - May the crocodile be against them in water, and snakes against them on land. May the hippopotamus be against them on water, and the scorpion against them on land. (On the first anniversary of entering the tomb the archaeologist's cousin died, then his uncle on the second, and his aunt on the third)
3. The Grudge: The Curse is created when someone is violently murdered and suffers so much emotional agony that their spirit/soul/etc essentially becomes part of the place in which they died (like a home). If anyone has the misfortune of discovering said place, that person is infected by the spirit's undying rage. The spirit or onryo \[sorry windows is not recognizing o macron\] follows the victims back to where they live and kills them as an act of revenge.
4. Forgotten Curse: (Elder Scrolls: Oblivion - The Grey Fox): No one remembers you. All records of your existence vanish. People can only remember you as long as you are within their field of vision. As soon as they can't see you, all memory of you vanishes. You are the eternal stranger. [**World\_of\_Ideas**](
5. Medusa's Curse: The victim is cursed in such a way that the very sight of them causes death or transformation into a statue. The victim is forced to live out their life in isolation.  [**World\_of\_Ideas**](
6. Slow Transformation into a plant (Fallout 3 - Harold the ghoul): Over the course of a few years the victim slowly turns green. They begin to sprout twigs and leaves, their skin starts to become covered with bark. At some point their movement becomes slow and difficult. Eventually they become rooted to the spot. Sapient, aware, in constant pain, but unable to move. Their condition makes it so they will probably live for centuries in this condition. [**World\_of\_Ideas**](
7. Werewolf Curse: There is a periodic event that caused the victim to transform into a monster that is consumed by (blood lust, hunger, rage). While in this state the victim goes on an uncontrollable killing spree. [**World\_of\_Ideas**](
8. Curse of the graverobber (""Odyssey of the Dragonlords"" module): This curse is applied to those who steal from sanctified tombs or other holy places. The victim becomes extremely hungry and thirsty, but will vomit up anything they eat or drink. They will retch themselves bloody until dying of thirst. However if the victim returns the stolen property to its rightful place and begs the gods for forgiveness, it just might be granted.  [**getVitaminD**](
9. Eidolons Curse: Designed as a fitting Retribution for grave robbers that steal out of selfish motives. The Targets mind is struck and slowly but steadily it looses its sense of self. Firstly the curse affects any aspect of the cursed life that it takes the most pleasure from, numbing it until it makes them feel nothing. Next the curse errodes any connections the Target feels towards any possessions it has. It still remembers all about them but looses all feelings it may have felt towards them before. Simularly all feelings towards places begin to errode for the Target, all meaning they once had for the cursed is replaced by a general hollowness. Then the connections towards other people the subject of the curse had are removed slowly, hate, love, friendship, all is replaced by apathy. Finally the curse homes in on the target itself, any memory it has will loose value to it, its goals are simularly affected, the stronger the Targets Will the longer this will take. In the end the Target is left with total apathy for the world and itself. Even fleeting thoughts that enter the Targets mind leave without impact.  [**Yranic**](
10. Curse of Solitude: bad, seemingly unrelated things happen to everyone that you care about, or even everyone you got to know a little bit better or connect with, when you’re around.  [**admiralhayreddin**](
11. Curse of the Eldritch: A curse often cast by cults or found in ancient temples and dungeons. The curse slowly transforms the afflicted into an eldritch abomination. It spreads throughout body parts seemingly at random, but generally affects extremities such as hands and feet first then moves to the torso and usually leaves the head for last. The changes during the curse's progress can range wildly, such as hands transforming into claws, tentacles sprouting, eyeballs growing across the body, bones melting or rearranging, facial features vanishing, but all with some kind of purpose, as the final product is certainly more than just a collection of random mutations. The end result can only be described as an eldritch abomination.  [**Aninx**](
12. Arachne Curse: Similar to the drider curse at first glance, the arachne curse is often cast by drow on other races or by evil druids or wizards upon unsuspecting adventurers. The curse begins by causing severe pain in the lower body and a loss of balance, as if the affected feels they should have more legs to walk with. Within a day, the affected sprouts spider legs equal to eight minus their original number of legs. The affected's abdomen begins to bloat and lengthen into a spider's, then their original legs grow thinner and twist into spider legs. The affected then shrinks down to a small size, no greater than 2 to 3 feet in height. Their eyes split into eight and they grow mandibles, now unable to eat solid food. In some cases, the affected's vocal cords shift as well so they can no longer speak. The affected never experiences any mental changes during this curse, and they are always fully aware of what is happening to them.  [**Aninx**](
13. Armored Curse: Usually found on a cursed set of armor, but sometimes will be cast on one wearing full heavy armor. The armor is unable to be taken off, and any missing pieces such as gloves, pants, or helmets will appear. Over time, the affected begins to feel weaker, as if they were wasting away. Their limbs then start to feel as if they are slowly dissolving. Then they will find it hard to breathe and shortly thereafter, their lungs shrivel up in their chest and they will be unable to breathe, but will find they don't need to anymore. Over time they will feel their muscles and bones atrophy and vanish and organs wither away one by one until they are nothing more than a suit of animated armor.  [**Aninx**](
14. Hermit's Waste: A progressive magical affliction related to depression. Foments in people who have no strong ties in their lives, either socially or with regards to identity. The lack of association with the broader world makes the world itself forget about them, which disrupts natural processes and natural law as it impacts them.  [**kelltain**](
   1. Early stages may cause minor effects, such as occasional reversions of small actions, or the loss of one's reflection or shadow. Middling stages start to impact physical health, and have more severe impact on physical law--a sufferer will occasionally pass through surfaces, or be ignored by gravity, or lose physical sensation. At this stage, organs may fail outright, although this does not always lead to the subject's death, as causality becomes more malleable. Later stages has the subject losing physical coherence, becoming ghostlike. The skin becomes transparent, eyes lose the ability to rotate, orifices seal or new ones split open. Eventually subjects cease to exist entirely, the world having forgotten of them, what remaining associations they had becoming displaced onto other entities. In all stages, reversing the effects only requires forging ties with the world at large (the simple act of a solitary conversation having been sufficient to add days to weeks to a subject's outlook), but must be done so carefully, as the affliction provides implicit defenses against the harms it incurs.
15. Curse of the chasm: This curse makes the person unable to gain any nourishment from food. A favourite of hags and witches, it has caused several large famines.  [**underscoreSeller**](
16. Curse of pliancy: This curse makes you unable to refuse a direct order from anyone. It is often used by powerful fairies, sometimes with a certain 'command word' that activates the curse.  [**underscoreSeller**](
17. Curse of jumping shadows: This curse makes you blind for a random hour each day. It seems to have a sense of good (bad?) timing, as it often activates in the middle of a fight or other danger.  [**underscoreSeller**](
18. Curse of the crone: This curse instantly ages you to an elderly state, but doesn't decrease your lifespan, so you are forced to live for decades in this weakened condition.  [**underscoreSeller**](
19. Curse of the phantom dragon: This curse raises your body temperature by one degree every minute until you boil to death from the inside. It is often used to guard treasure, afflicting anyone who touches the valuables without proper safeguards.  [**underscoreSeller**](
20. Curse of the frozen sun (*Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous*): This curse makes a person see demons as humans and vice versa. Demons use it to trick and torment a victim before killing them.  [**underscoreSeller**](
21. The curse of Kenny (South Park - Kenny). The victim is doomed to die over and over. Each time they die, they will be reborn with their memories intact including the memory of dying. Each death will occur in a different manor from the last. [**World\_of\_Ideas**](
22. Curse of the Reaper: prerequisite character must have died. They then were conscripted by Death and Fate to collect the souls of individuals. They are returned to the material plane, with an altered appearance so that they will not be recognized, and given a list of names. They have to carry out their duties as subtly as possible, because if they are revealed they are pulled back to Fate's presence and reprimanded. If they try to return to friends or family from their previous life all memories of that life will vanish. On the up side, life span is infinite (retirement is only available when a predetermined number of souls have been collected; alternatively a reaper may be killed by dismemberment and cremation, or at the hands of Death), injuries heal very rapidly (they dont hurt any less though), inebriants have minimal effect (including poison), ability to see Death's minions (shadowy beings that alter the course of individuals destined for death), soul touch (ability to pull a soul from a person's body, only to be used on those about to die, if a soul isnt collected it will rot and turn into an undead), gain the trance ability (sleep is for the dead and technically you are now undead)  [**sd8135**](
23.Vision of Decay:  The victim perceives everything as if it is decaying.  All people and creatures appear as if they are zombified decaying corpses.  All plants appear as if wilted and rotting.  All food appears and taste as if it is spoiled and rotting.  All structures appear as if dilapidated. [**World\_of\_Ideas**](

24. Inability to Heal:  Your wounds do not heal.  Even magic healing doesn't seem to work on you.  Even if you are careful, you will eventually be overwhelmed by (scratches, scrapes, bruises, splinters, blisters, sunburn, pulled muscles, etc), that you gain over time. [**World\_of\_Ideas**](

25.Progeny of Monsters:  All of your children will turn into monsters (body and mind).  If they are not slain they will go on killing rampages.[**World\_of\_Ideas**](
123,"Y’all, magic is hard to learn and harder to master. There’s bound to be some mildly lethal hiccups along the way… but hey! Finding yourself in perilous situations CONSTANTLY just means you’re learning that much faster! 

Welcome to  the Eldritch wind academy for the arcane!!!

And p.s, watch your step. There’s magical traps everywhere and we can’t seem to remember where we put them. 

HUZZAH 

*disappears in smoke*

Hello everyone, as you can maybe assume, I’m running a fairly comedic oriented, short form campaign for newer players, and I thought a magic school that leans into its inherent and blatant dangers would make a fun playground for unhinged creativity. I would love a table to roll on that creates wacky problems for my players to solve, seemingly at random *maniacal laughter*.

1. The party hears of a plan to prank the headmaster by banishing them to the astral and finding out if they are native to the plane. Do they help the students? Or narc and earn some valuable brownie points?

2. The toilets are clogged. Who keeps flushing those wet wipes?? They are bad for the pipes!! To make matters worse, the aberrations eating all that waste at the bottom of the system are getting hungry and restless, yikes.

3. Young love is hard, and magic doesn’t make it easier. After finding out his parter cheated on him, a student turned his boyfriend into cheese. When faculty tried to reason with him to drop the spell, he threatened  to add mice to the equation. Since his family are big donators to the school, expulsion isn’t really an option… (you know how it goes), so the party has to step in instead.

4. Illusionary dragon on the loose! Distracted with talking to her friend, a student messed up her magic circle to cast an illusionary dragon, and accidentally made it permanent! It would be fairly easy to dispel, but a student club of arcane environmentalists is pushing back, claiming the creature has a will, and therefore a right to existence, regardless of it’s solidity. While all this is happening, the dragon is fully loose and wreaking havoc, sending droves of kids into the medical wards.

5. Legions of students are going to the medical wards with cases of bad stomach aches. The kitchens say nothing has changed, regardless of recent budget cuts. But the party swears the food seems to almost be moving recently…

6. It’s student preview weekend!!!! Time to hide all the skeletons under the red carpet rolled out for prospective new young mages. 
 (once they sign the waivers and contracts to begin their studies, we got ‘em for good)
The party can choose to be a tour guide for either the parents or the children, each leading to shenanigans unfolding. If they choose parents, will the party be able to keep all the crazy none-sense all over the school under wraps, lest they incur the wrath of the headmaster? Or will they choose the children? Who are children… and uncontrollably magical… and unhinged gremlins with serious behavior issues… oh no, there gonna fit right in won’t they… will the party survive WAY to many rolls on the wild magic table? Only one way to find out!

7. Transmosqurifiers are everywhere! They are mosquito-like insects whose bite causes a random transmogrification to what they bite.

8. The return of the pandalance - a monster that is perfectly safe to everything …everything that isn’t a panda! It targets pandas and runs them through with a ridiculously powerful piercing attack. With the pandalance here, the planned sports game can’t occur because the other school is mostly, you guessed it, pandas!


9. Magical bizarreness happens, but it’s usually quite random. The number three is appearing more frequently than players would expect. Groups of three, three doors where there should be one, three fingers, etc. None of the changes seem to be permanent. What’s happening? How do we fix it? Is it a bigger lead or a totally desperate phenomena? Is there one answer to this problem? …or three?

10. Someone at the school is misusing the school’s magic amplification effects. At night, they drop the protections around the school (quite the feat!) and use the school’s powers to interfere with international politics. A poor investigation points toward a very outspoken student. The real culprit is actually one of the adventurers, who has been sleep waking due to an item them the picked up (or some other effect) from earlier.

11. Every time we eat the corn bread, we get some serious gas. It’s, like, a magical amount of flatulence. DC 6 investigation and you realize it doesn’t stink. DC 15 and you suspect it’s just air, not farts. In fact, it is air. And it’s enough in quantity to allow for breathing for ten minutes per cornbread brick. Hmmm…this could be handy.

12. You died. You, the player second to the DM’s left, are dead. Bye! (How do the others react? Do they call the nurse? Investigate? Laugh?) 

13. Magic sex ed. some out of touch, ancient teacher talking about wand safety, disgusting. The party needs to escape, like now. No matter the cost. Can the party escape this nightmareish situation undetected? And can they escape the dreaded  HaLl MoNiteRS, Nazgûlesque creatures who will wrap you in chains of undeath and drag you back to class?

14. The schools sportsball team all came down with a mysterious illness. Too bad the competition is tonight and the opposing teams looks smug. 

15. The Submerged Magic class has been cancelled. The teacher has disappeared and there's only a puddle of water left behind.

16. The senior class is panicking. Finals are coming up but every abjuration spells is backfiring and no one knows why. Two seniors are already with the nurse sporting nasty burns.

17. It's time for the Enchanted Ball and everyone is excited to put on their best gowns - except all the popular kids noses and ears have started to swell to enormous proportions. Is it the usual suspects or something more devious?

18. The principal has always been a bit of a hardass, but now his eyes are rolled back in his head and he speaks with a deep, gravely voice. The vice principal seems concerned, but unsure what to do.

19. The school janitor collects broken magical artifacts and is supposed to dispose of them, but he's been collecting them and now he's experimenting with them.

20. A possession spell has gone awry. Every PC hands their character sheet one person to the right.  because they are now inhabiting the character whose sheet they are holding.

21. Potion of In-visibility - During a potions brewing class one of the students measured ingredients incorrectly, and now their skin is transparent. And horrifying. They need your help to make the cure and save their grade.

22. The librarian's hearing is going, to make up for it, they are taking potions to compensate. The dose is too high and the librarian is going crazy chasing students who defile the library by doing things like walking in the library, or breathing heavily."
124,"# Player

I have a player that is an Eldritch Knight and was a known criminal from the dark and seedy underbelly in my high fantasy city adventure placed in a megalopolis nation. He has been caught for his past actions but is given an ultimatum to do mundane tasks to complete his Community Service or else go to jail. **The initial question was how do I make regular community service deeds more fantasy like?**

# World

The entire nation is a mega city with high rise stone buildings and very little space to move about. The best comparison I can make is Cyberpunks Night City but fantasy instead of Sci Fi. However magic is highly regulated by the nation and which a license is required to cast magic that very few want to put in the time to learn. There are monsters and knights fighting wizard criminals but it's become underrated by the general populace as it has become the norm. Almost kind of like the absurdity you would see in Discworld or Futurama.

Playing with these concept I've made just a few to figure out what deeds my criminal player needs to do to be absolved of all past crimes. Every in game week he needs to complete a full service of duty in which it will be magically recorded and activate a Scrying spell that will notify the players parole officers (Which are the other party members)

127,"When you mess with the passage of time in your craft, it starts to bend around you, leaving its mark on how you look, think, and act.

This is primarily meant for chronurgy wizards, but it could also apply to others who have experienced repeated strange time effects (e.g. someone who has traveled back and forth from the Feywild and experienced lots of weird time distortions in the process; someone who has spent centuries without aging while in the Astral Sea). 

The quirks should mostly be for flavor and affect personality or appearance rather than mechanics, but minor mechanical effects can work too.

**d100 Chronomancer Quirks**

1. When they heal, whether naturally or by magic, their wounds literally reverse themselves, a process which is observable to anyone who happens to be watching.
2. Their heartbeat sounds like a ticking clock.
3. Clock faces and other timekeeping devices sometimes manifest on their skin overnight, appearing like animated tattoos.
4. Their hair and fingernails grow abnormally fast or slow.
5. When they're focused on something, they move as if in fast-forward.
6. They can speak backwards flawlessly.
7. They sometimes reflexively react to things that haven't happened yet, like wincing in pain seconds before actually being injured.
8. They age out of order, making it very difficult to guess how old they are. They may look older one year and younger the next, or they may have some features of a very young person and others of a very old person.
9. Instead of blood, they bleed sand.
10. When making big decisions, the voices of many possible futures whisper in their ears, threatening to overwhelm them.
11. They talk about the past in the future tense, and the future in the past tense.
12. They talk about legendary events of the distant past as if they were current events.
13. They vastly over- or underestimate how old other people are.
14. When humming to themselves, they often hum songs that haven't been written yet.
15. They hate waiting, and their impatience makes them impulsive.
16. They have the uncanny ability to guess what someone looked like as a child or predict what someone will look like when they're older.
17. Their dreams often include abstract references to future events.
18. They have a distorted view of time, thinking 5 minutes is an excruciatingly long time but a century is insignificantly short.
19. They have impeccable internal timekeeping. If someone tells them to be somewhere in an hour, they'll be there in *exactly* an hour – down to the second – without even trying.
20. They are clearly uncomfortable around things designed to not change much — like stone statues — and decorate with flowers and other rapidly-changing things. /Locke2300]
21. They have a tendency to answer you just before you ask the question. /World_of_Ideas]
22. Their age fluctuates between a younger and older form. They are always adult, but their age varies between 20 and 50. /World_of_Ideas]
23. They occasionally stare at (someone, something) as if expecting them to be different. /World_of_Ideas]
24. They have difficulty forming strong attachments to people, having traveled to timelines before they were born, after they have died, or timelines that have been altered so they are very different. /World_of_Ideas]
25. After using magic, they appear slightly out of phase with reality, their appearance lagging their physical form by half a second or so, sort of like watching a person move on a low resolution camera. The effect lasts longer depending on how powerful the spell used was. /houinator]
26. Their thoughts move in either slow motion or at lightning speed. Sometimes they'll appear to be staring off into space mindlessly while others they'll be bombarding you with a million ideas in 30 seconds. /tarsn]
27. They have tattoos referencing future events they have no recollection of all over their body. The tattoos change as major events take place or big decisions are made. /tarsn]
28. They carry around a pet or familiar that's caught in a time loop, constantly repeating the same actions with no awareness of the outside world. To outsiders this may appear as an elaborate and incredibly realistic toy. /tarsn]
29. They sometimes fall behind or pull ahead of someone they're walking alongside; neither party notices immediately. /RollinThundaga]
30. Their meals occasionally spoil in the midst of being eaten. /RollinThundaga]
31. Immediately before or after using stairs, they'll occasionally trip and stub their toe on a phantom step. /RollinThundaga]
32. They have terrible hand-eye coordination. /RollinThundaga]
33. Animals near the chronomancer will often jump as though startled by them, even if they are sitting still. /RollinThundaga]
34. Bonfires, torches, and candles nearby will sometimes conflagrate and burn down in an instant. Other times, they will burn slowly while producing little warmth or light. /RollinThundaga]
35. They are constantly checking the time on their pocket watch or by asking others for the current year. /Fishstik2691]
36. They have strange knickknacks with no known origin. /Fishstik2691]
37. They have a heavily guarded notebook that no one is allowed to see. After meeting someone they’ll check their notebook (to make sure they don’t reveal things the other person shouldn’t know yet). /Fishstik2691]
38. They often repeat themselves or get stuck in loops of thought others need to break them from. /Fishstik2691]
39. Sometimes, they mistake people for one of their ancestors or descendants. /Fishstik2691]
40. The chronomancer is stuck in their moment of death. After screwing up a spell intended to grant them an immortal body, they began to rapidly decay. An arcane knee jerk reaction caused them to extend their moment of death to an undetermined amount of time. They are now pretty much just a skeleton with dementia in constant pain. They have moments of lucidity in which they will become focused, writing down or telling people near by what they did to themselves, that it hurts and how, where and when to end it. These moments are short not allowing for much information to be salvaged. They get frustrated afterwards and destroy the writings or dismiss their previous statements. /chesolestrada]
41. They constantly mistake people for others and insist that they know them, known them for years. /chesolestrada]
42. They often become confused and think they're in the middle of something.... Something important, it has to be important....an important.... something. Who are you? /chesolestrada]
43. They're confident that ""this isn't how I die"" and can be reckless because of that confidence. /chesolestrada]
44. They give random presents to people that make no sense. However, days, weeks, months, or years later that gift now makes sense. /Adventux]
45. No one can keep time, nearby the individual. Watches, clocks, sundials, hourglasses, etc. are always wrong, nearby. /Arkenstihl]
46. The individual often remembers events that have not yet occured, which may no longer occur once shared with others. /Arkenstihl]
47. When the individual dreams, there is a significant chance of time distortion. For example, the individual once went to sleep on a soft patch of bare dirt and woke up tangled in aged vines. /Arkenstihl]
48. Small things around them move forward or backward in time when they stay in a specific area for too long. After a long or short rest, things like plants have a chance of being taller or shorter than everything else in the area. Timepieces are mostly unusable around them, and they will slowly drift forwards or backwards in time at random rates. /LastMasters]
49. They forget when they are. They can use an action to make a DC15 perception check to determine when they are. On a failure, they can not act nor move - however they can react. /ButtonholePhotophile]
50. They will sometimes receive physical messages in random places where no one should have been able to track them down...from themselves. /mia_elora]
51. Any time they look at a clock or watch, the hands spin randomly. /parzalot]
52. Their irises contain the moving hands of a clock. /Holy_Hand_Grenadier]
53. They are extremely health-conscious because of the potentially disastrous effects of bringing a disease to a time when immune systems don't know how to handle it. /bhelhop]
54. They occasionally ""get stuck in a loop"" for a few seconds, repeating a phrase or action in exactly the same way, and then then then then then moving normally again like nothing happened. /bhelhop]
55. Their sleep needs are wildly inconsistent. Sometimes they wake up after three hours and function fine, other times they'll be dead to the world for sixteen hours. /bhelhop]
56. They hate indecisiveness, claiming that it ""increases the risk of dangerous timeline-splitting"". They try to make any important choices as quickly as possible. /bhelhop]
57. They occasionally adopt elderly or childish mannerisms, only to snap out of it after a few minutes. /bhelhop]
58. They occasionally find a minor useful item nearby when it should not logically be there. They claim that they left it for themself in the past. /bhelhop]
59. After any important event, they chalk strange symbols on a nearby surface, which they claim are codes to help time travellers identify the situation. /bhelhop]
60. They claim that errors in memory can be the result of remembering what the past was like before it was changed. This is possibly just an excuse to not admit when their memory is wrong. /bhelhop]
61. They are usually seen stopping minor accidents to happen, like preventing a cup of coffee from falling on the floor or someone from slipping on a puddle. /Sandro2017]
62. Their favourite phrase is ""There is no time to explaaain!!!"" /Sandro2017]
63. They are obsessed thinking that a killer from the future wants to kill them in the past for something they haven't done yet. /Sandro2017]

128,"I'm looking to make a list to pull from to make skeletons a bit more interesting than just, you know, skeletons. I'm looking for quirks mainly, things independent from just interesting fantasy races or something.

&#x200B;

1. A skeleton marked with Phrenological markings / measurements.
2. A skeleton with it's jaw wired shut, and a few rusty, iron joint and bone replacements.
3. A skeleton with a black wax candle melting on it's head. Wax drips down it's body.
4. A skeleton who's teeth have been replaced with sharp, bloody, iron spikes.
5. Skull that at one point was used as a wine goblet. Wine still sloshes out as it moves. Alternatively, it is covered with deep, purpleish wine stains.
6. A skull that was put in a vice at some point. The vice still hangs from it's head.
7. A skeleton with something alive inside it. Tentacles peak from the eyesockets, and occasionally an inhuman eye peers out. Smells like salt water.
8. A skeleton with heavy chains running through it's eye sockets and weaving in between it's ribs. Several padlocks hang from it. Someone wanted this one to stay in one piece.
9. A skeleton wrapped tightly in canvas, painted intricately by a classical painter.
10. A skeleton with steel blinders, caps over its ears, and it’s jaw wired shut. It’s ribs are marked in Sylvan runes. “See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil”.  \/I-Identify-Guns\]
11. A skeleton with iron nails driven into the the bones. \/Splendidissimus\]
12. This skeleton's bones don't match. One arm is noticeably longer than the other, and it literally has two left feet. \/Splendidissimus\]
13. A skeleton coated in sticky, flambable pitch. \/Splendidissimus\]
14. A skeleton with a small tree growing out of its eye. The roots appear to hang down into its rib cage. \/ken_NT\]
15. A skeleton that was decorated in a shamanic rite. It is covered in patterns painted with natural dyes, and instead of cartilages holding it together, it got intricate woven fibers and ropes. Its eyesockets contain polished wooden balls \/Testthra\]
16. A skeleton that's partially clockwork. Flywheels and gears can be seen and heard inside the skull and the ribcage, and parts are covered in brass sheets or wire, and riveted together  \/Testthra\]
17. A skeleton with six fingers on each hand, six toes on each foot. \/[**Thisfoxhere**](

Then time jump the players slightly forward with no explanation and no memory of what happened after that crechendo. \/[**cdaly18**](

38. ~~a couple of skeletons called like Dave and Steve with mops and brooms, coming after the fight, greeting any adventurer, and scrubbing the floor while chatting between them about ""the game last night"". They don't acknowledge what sort of game it is, whistle without lips, and generally don't die. They also seem to appear out of nowhere whenever no one's looking. (~~edit: oops didn't see the flair at first, sorry) \/[**Logan\_Maddox**](
39. A skeleton wandering around the aftermath of a battle, picking bones out of the bodies, swapping some out with their own, putting some into a leather sack and adding the finest into a large cloak of rattling bones that sound like wind chimes as they walk. \/[**Chimera64000**](

129,"A permit functions like a combination of tax and vetting. So a permit would cost money, like a tax. But, it's also a way for local authorities to control who gets to do what, and keep tabs of them. I mean, if you live near a village of giants, you don't want just anyone to go mess with them because if they mess up, the giants will come and level the village. You want to ensure only people capable are allowed to deal with them, right? Similarly, if you run a world with 5e style magic where they can create things out of thin air, wouldn't the local authorities want to keep tabs on this? Can't have some wandering wizard screw up the entire local economy. What other specific permits and/or taxes might be relevant in a fantasy world with magic and different types of creatures?

&#x200B;

This may sound kind of dumb, and it's definitely not for every group. But I considered everything a form of progression. And as a group, they can progress not only through buying a castle, or getting henchmen, or whatever. But also through what they are legally allowed to do, which can also influence who gets in contact with the players and the kind of gigs they can take and are offered.

130,"In my homebrew, the kingdoms of the world were attacked by demonic forces. The war was brutal and many sacrifices and advancements were made for the sake of survival. Following the war, the god of law and justice locked away many of these advancements and the memories of their existence for the sake of the civilized world. The reason the god provided was that these items/technologies/concepts were too inhumane, too powerful for mortal hands or that they too heavily warped nature and magic.

Bonus points for something fate/destiny themed or dwarven/elven.

1. Book of Fate: Writing in the Book of Fate changes the past and present of any individual's life.
2. Font of Memories: These waters contain the memories of that which was locked away. Some of this water is scattered throughout in liquid and frozen form. Boiling it will return the memories to all those who should know them.
3. Dwarven Technology: Technology based around steam and electricity. Wide-spread use over an area has the side-effect of eliminating magic in that area.
4. Dwarven Power Suit: 1 charge. Increases user's base strength to 30 for one minute.
5. Advanced Blunderbuss: 2 charges. Fires in a 30ft cone. Enemies must make a DC{8+prof+DEX} dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 force damage.
6. Battery pack: provides charges to certain items.
7. Elven Life Crystal: When used properly as a catalyst, can be used to give or take life from an individual.
8. Memory Jewel: Can be used to store and remove personal memories.
9. Crystalline Slug: These come in pairs. When inserted through the ear, they allow you to communicate telepathically with the other person.

10. Lawbreaker: Lawbreakers are a form of written word infused with magic that is capable of manipulating the laws of the world, such as causing storms to form or reversing gravity, and were sometimes weaponized by etching them into spears (or other weapons) that applied the effect to what it hits. One such etched spear is buried in the body of a powerful demon, who would revive when the weapon is removed.
11. Legendsmith: The dwarves once made a way to honor their warriors, and did so with the Legendsmith, a hammer capable of making it's works legends, cementing them in the minds of mortals. Consequentially, it can strengthen things through the power of belief.
12. Concordant Arc: This bow pierces both present and future, consolidating all possibilities into a single result. This causes destinies of its victims to end short, and to be forever tainted by any major wounds caused. It's also known for giving its wielders extraordinary aim, as the possible future where it hits nothing at all is destroyed once it's shot. It is unknown what, if any role this weapon played in the war.
13. Technothurgy: The dwarves and elves once allied to craft a method to fuse the wild mechanics of magic and the certainty of technology together, creating the study of Technothurgy. Technothurgy improves on the mechanics of technology, and makes magic more consistent and easy, although with the downside of limiting it's strongest effects. Given the basic tools of technothurgy, powerful but unstable magic items became exceedingly easy to create.
14. Veilcutter: This unseeming dagger has the ability to pierce both space and flesh alike, and every intended cut can open a gap in space — be it to other worlds, or into an enemy's back. It's victims are known for being given a seemingly shallow cut, only to be sucked into a rift, never to be seen again. (Potentially mysteriously disappeared mid-war when it was sucked into it's own rift, and is possibly resting in another plane of existence or space?)
15. Tenets of Reality: Whether stolen from gods or the place where the world itself was formed, these many books each represent a single rule that the universe as a whole functions on, and each can be altered. Although it is impossible to completely eradicate a rule and to even harm the book it lies in, it is possible to chance how it functions and in what ways, causing those changes to be seen from the present onwards. (Possible narrative use: Is why the god of law finally intervened with the war, the rewriting of a rule might have been the driving cause of the war as suddenly the demonic forces may now have been able to invade the world, etc).

16. Bullets of Unmaking: These “bullets” are actually crystalline spheres about 1 foot in diameter, jointly developed by rogue dwarven priests of Moradin, an unnamed Demi-lich, and Evard the elven wizard.
When looked at directly, the observer sees a somewhat inert and hazy sphere. Staring for one full round causes severe nausea and lapses in memory. Viewed indirectly through reflections or in peripheral vision shows the sphere as crystal clear and containing writhing black tentacles.
Traditionally used as ammunition for various siege weapons, shattering Bullets of Unmaking unleash a devious version of Evard’s Black Tentacles. Viewed directly, those grasped by the tentacles seemingly vanish. Viewed indirectly or in peripheral vision, victims grasped by the tentacles appear to be impossibly crushed and contorted until a single drop of water falls to the ground. Those who are unmade by the tentacles are forgotten by all who personally knew them.

17. Collar of domestication: a magical item created to make any wild creature domesticated or knowledge thereof. The collar is of elven design and blatantly portrays a god of nature shackled and screaming furiously. Elves must make a wisdom save on seeing it or be frightened. Neither elves or half elves can touch it. (My thoughts are that if your elves are stereotypical nature lovers and most of your world's land is unclaimed by civilization, the concept of the elves having tried to domesticate the world and failed would be a good explanation for both.)

18. A dwarven made stone engraving that depicts the Dwarves slaying a god and the remains being used to fuel a great device, the section that would show the device is stained red, small chips of bone in the stone, and scratched out with the same words written over and over again. They are the dwarven words for 'please forgive us'.

19. A small dwarven time piece that when tinkered with can rewind time a few seconds (one re-roll a day) has a small chance of spawning a celestial hostile to whoever has the time piece. (Did you think the gods would stand idle while such heresy was performed?)

20. The name of a devil. Speaking the name will summon the devil, who will then follow a contract made and provide information that was sequestered away from the god of law and justice. (Note: the devil will give skewed information and leave out key details. Furthermore, until they give all the information, they remain in the material plane. Asking them for all the information while under a zone of truth spell will banish them back to the hells.)

21. Namemaker: swap the target’s true name and therefore innate power with a random creature on the same plane of existence.

22. A Dwarven Howitzer, The Dragon Breaker: a massive steam powered, partly Magitech cannon that the Dwarves made to shoot down dragons that couldn't take the hint to leave them alone. While powerful, it's size makes it a seige weapon but it can be pulled by large enough beasts or Giants.

23. Food heater: an electric food heater that uses energy waves to makes food way too hot on the outside and cold on the inside.

24. Pithing Spike/Pithing Anchor: A short metal spike, a bit longer than the index finger, with a sharp point on one end, and a flat, glyph-engraved gem on the other. When an ally falls on the battlefield, this spike can be driven through their foreheads, which either a) re-animates the corpse as a mindless undead fighter, or perhaps b) anchors the soul of the slain person to their body, giving them limited period of time during which they can still fight for the cause by ""piloting"" their own dead bodies as fearless, painless, partly-anesthetized, partly-diminished versions of themselves.

25. Necrotic Arrow: An otherwise innocuous-looking arrow with an atypically long, slender, and needle-sharp bodkin head, made of a smooth, satin black material that showed a slight greenish sheen when held up to the light. Unlike mundane materials that would blunt and fold and be rendered useless when striking hard armor, this supernaturally robust point will pierce even case-hardened steel plate with relative ease. Once lodged in the flesh, however, the arrowhead becomes soft and friable--notably causing the shaft to detach, or be removed easily--and begins to leach a necrotizing agent (chemical? biological? magical?) into the hapless victim, blackening the flesh, and causing it to slough off. Any limb struck by this weapon is lost, and the only hope to save the victim's life is to amputate the limb in under an hour, lest the rapidly-spreading corruption reach their vital organs. The now-soft arrowhead material is nearly impossible to completely cleanse from a wound, and even if done so immediately, would still cause the limb to bloat and bruise, and painfully wither to uselessness. A strike by such a weapon to the vitals is particularly ghastly, causing a horrific, lingering death as the victim's body degrades and disintegrates and decomposes from under them. Only the most heroic of magical healing can negate these effects; most attempts at such healing, at best, somewhat mitigate the damage.

26. Vampiric weapons: Tactically amazing, morally problematic outside of total war.

27. Basilisk Blood: Maybe literally the blood of a basilisk, or (more likely) just named for the similarity of its effect to the mythical beast, this iridescent, carmine liquid turns any living tissue it touches to stone. Spectacularly dangerous to the wielder when employed as weapon, this alchemical product was used with horrific effect when contained within glass ampules attached to the end of a cloth-yard shaft. Unforeseen by the munition's creators is the fact the high-speed impacts from this delivery method tended not just to splash the liquid about, but atomize it as well; when nearby creatures inhaled micro-droplets of this substance, it functionally embedded their lungs with gravel. A small handful of the insanely brave, the ignorantly foolhardy, or the suicidally desperate were known to throw thin-walled glass bottles at their enemies in combat, but most would regard such a weapon the same as they would a venomous snake.

28. Animated/""dancing"" weapons (i.e., autonomous/drone weapon platforms)
29. Warding glyphs/sigils (i.e., landmines)
30. Golems (i.e., also autonomous weapons platforms--analogous to a tank, maybe?)

31. Perpetual Motion Machine"

134,"A jerk of a noble is hosting a gathering with exhibits of their prize possessions. The central display is a normally well-locked up magical heirloom recently obtained from another noble, who had used it as collateral for a loan and then was just 3 days late with payment.  Who is at the party?

While this party comes from a one-shot I want to run, it seems that this kind of party/ball could fit in many campaigns (The one-shot looks like a fun setup - [ if you are interested).

Note: NPCs 20 through 34 have intertwining backstories courtesy of \/Funkyb\]. The original document from  \/Funkyb\] with all the details including stats is here: [

# d100 NPCs at a noble’s brag party (and their goal)

1. **Kilskax Naquin**, blue dragonborn, young adult, 3rd child of a rich noble family. Loves spending and having money without the responsibilities. Goal: Enjoy the festivities and scope out the items on display. Maybe make an offer to purchase, if one catches his eye.
2. **Gonek Pebblemane**, older dwarf in noble clothing; on inspection can tell the clothing is worn, but with skilled patching and repairs. Keeps a bit to himself but will join conversation if approached.  Smooth talker. Goal: Find an opportunity to steal one of the exhibits. Has a couple servants paid off to assist in escape. If he catches someone else stealing, is willing to stay quiet for a split of the profits – but is not above sounding the alarm to create a hubbub as a distraction… and then steal something else.
3. **The Lord (or Lady) Arenson**. A lanky half-elf, raven hair, dark blue suit, appears wealthy. Is actually a noble who was cast out from their family and used disguise self to establish a new noble identity – two, actually, as unbeknownst to others, Arenson is both the Lord and the Lady Arenson depending on the day and the scam. Loves to scam the wealthy by selling fake items or playing rigged games. Goal: Scope out and gain trust of potential new targets for scams. Will “accidentally” assist in shenanigans if opportunity arises.
4. **Conner Karanek**. A young adult half-orc, from a mostly-human minor noble family. The other family members were not invited, especially his father (who is orcish). He is the token “monstrous race” so that the host noble can look good, and he knows it.  Was instructed by his family to not rock the boat. Goal: Schmooze a bit with the nobles worth talking to. Watches for ways to subtly undermine the host noble – for example, if looking at an exhibit might mention that “it doesn’t look quite real, I wonder if it might be a very good forgery.  No, it must not be, I’m sure \[noble\] would have had it checked.”  Will look the other way at any shenanigans.
5. **Cam**, a bright-eyed cat slinking around the proceedings; one of several mousing cats of the nobles’ but the only one around the party.  Ignored by most. Actually has been awakened for several years.  Goal: Snatch up some good food and good scritches
6. **Lord Branf Carling**, older halfling noble, friendly and loudly gregarious, sees more than he appears to. Doesn’t agree with the host noble’s methods, but he did follow the law…  Goal: Maintain his presence among nobles. Also suspects there could be thievery attempts and is watching for suspicious activity.
7. **Alley Smithson**, servant of the host noble, curly black hair, dark skin, and slight build.  Making the rounds with drinks and foods on trays.  Goal: Keep everything running smoothly and everyone happy with full mugs and bellies.

They are the pet of another partygoer, they also spontaneously produce giant pearls, they were meant to be a gift to the noble, but now they have escaped and are hiding in the party.

9. **Mister Tayte**, a small dark haired brown man in exquisite clothing, his goal is to find out what happened to the dish he brought as he cannot find it anywhere. If assisted the dish can be found being hoarded by the head noble in secret because its so good.

Even releasing a fish thing into the wild or providing a servant to a strange old commoner. \/killllllllllmeeeeee\]
10. **Igor Grime**, a rather unattractive author extraordinaire and notable grammarian. He will continuously correct others way of speaking and since he is a self proclaimed genius, his word is generally taken as gospel (at least to those “intellectuals” within his circle). He is author to a number of murder mysteries and tends to go on and on about his passion, the imagery, and oh! his many muses. This last one is a hint, and as he drinks his desire to find a new muse gets stronger and stronger. However, his crooked teeth and his heavy aura of perfume make this search difficult. Every now and then, he will take out a small book and make note of any interesting characters or stories from their travels. Later on in the adventure, the party may come across a new best seller which is heavily based on one or more of them.  \/Slight_Tea\]
11. **Braum Lockhart the Brave**, a gallant local nobleman from a long line of horse breeders who prides himself as the slayer of a young green dragon. Really, it was a green drake and he knows it, but no one who has seen the head he brought back has known the difference. He hangs it above his fireplace, and he would love to show you it. Except for when you ask to see it, then he deflects to some other time if he thinks you would know the difference. Goal: He exaggerates his accomplishments because in an attempt to woo a noblewoman at the party named Annabelle Kingsley. \/psatch\]

14. **Lord  Jonathan Albercrombe** \- an elderly lord of considerable wealth and  influence in the kingdom. Always wears a mask and doesn't speak much.  This is because this ""Lord Albercrombe"" is, in reality, a body double hired to attend the event in the real Lord's stead. This was done to  assure everyone that Albercrombe is still fine and well so the other  nobles don't make any moves against him and his house. The real  Albercrombe is at his manor, bedridden with the plague. Goal: Maintain  the deception and Albercrombe's presence in polite society.  \/TheMultiuniverse\]

They  are friendly, exceedingly polite, and highly curious about mundane  things. It is known that they are well connected, grow and sell a large variety of medicinal herbs, and enjoy fine brandy. While apparently  waiting for someone to arrive, they are prone to strike conversation with an obscure quote. For those in the 'guild', they are viewed as a neutral intermediary involving assassinations, making ""house-calls"" to  establish business, under cover of social calls to the well-heeled or  nobility. Anyone in the guild speaks of ""Death Comes Quickly"" with  hushed tones. They are known for wearing a sprig of *geranium robertianum*,  (It actually grows from their body) and favor a strange perfume or  scent matching that of the aforementioned plant.  Their goal here is to network, and to deliver a warning to a prominent guest who has used  their services in the past, ""Payment is due on the Rise of the Moon,  lest She of the Owls be Angered."" \/MaxSizeIs\]

140,"Places for a dragon to die, usually of old age. A name and description, along with a reason for a dragon to go there to die.

1. Flying Death Isle: A flying island where dragons talk to each other in the hours leading up to their death.


2. Unseen Forest: When a Dragon doesn't want anyone to see them die, they head here, a forest that only dragons near death see. A special Elven tribe help them die peacefully with magic.


3. PiD Inc. Dragon Graveyard: PiD (Peace in Death) are a corporation dedicated to helping dragons get peace in their last moments. Human caretakers talk to the dragons as they die, letting their memory be remembered.


4. Ashmaker Volcano: If a dragon wants real, eternal peace in a land of necromancers and revivals, they can choose to burn alive in this magic volcano. So hot, not even most demons could survive.


5. Dragon Cult Dungeon: A dragon can make a deal to die early if their cult can be the ones to do it. The painlessness depends on the cult and their resources, however.


6. ""Point Draco"": a point in the ocean, far away from any form of civilization, to which certain species of dragon fly. The long journey eventually wears them out, and their corpses fall into the ocean below, where their bones join the ever shifting sands below.


7. ""The Dragon's Belt"": Dying dragons use the last of their vitality to reach the upper reaches of the atmosphere. Their corpses endlessly orbit the earth, one last, immortal chance to soar among the clouds.


8-11 by

8. ""Dragon's March Path"": A peaceful parade that seems to  strech for Infinity and across planes of existence. Here, dragons that are near their death or wish to die peacefully take upon themselves this march. Dragons who walk this path do so until their death, at which they turn into Stardust, unable to be resurrected, and visible as a constellation in the night sky.

9. ""Spires That Measure Time"": When a dragon is mortally wounded, near death, or wishes to die, they come here, where each type of dragon has a spire of previous Dragons who have passed. Younger dragons stick to the lower of the tower, holding the foundation, and the older the dragon, the higher they climb. Only the Eldest of GreatWyrms can reach the precipice of their respective Spire. When theybreacj their spot, they remain there, and turn to stone.

10. ""Dragon Wish Lake"": Dragons come here to have their last, passing wish granted, at the cost of their flesh and soul. Skeletons of Dragons surround the perimeter of the lake, with some sections a thick wall of bone.

11. ""The Forest"": Dragons who hear the unavoidable toll of death approaching come here to be absorbed by the earth. Massive trees make up a dense jungle, whose roots are wrapped around various dragon skeletons. Fruit from these trees grow at unimaginable heights, but are bigger than a house and make the eater immune to hunger or thirst.

12. ""The Well of Twilight"": In the inhospitable mountains, from the eyes of all mortals, there is a tremendous hole in the earth. Thousands of feet long and impeccably black, this hole's location is in the racial memory of all dragons. The wounded, the ancient, the proud and the shamed, dragons of all kinds head here at the end of their lives. Here is immortality, for as they fall into darkness their bodies are transformed. The last things they see are the lights of creation all around them, before they are turned into starstuff and transform into great constellations in the sky.

13. ""Angorn's Thread"": This thin thread runs on an infinite line across the curvature of space. Touching it is said to be the most painful thing possible. The intensity of the experience is said to carry through reincarnation, allowing parts of who you are now to follow you into the next life.

14. ""The Timeless Sands"": This desert is so arid and lifeless that corpses seem to cease to decay when submerged in the sand. Dragins with great vanity go here to die so that their bodies can endure as long as possible. A few resurfaced corpses are sites of pilgrimage.

15. ""The Eternal Armory"": Dragons who have become patrons of civilization or befriended humanoids will commission legendary crafters to use their corpse as one final gift. Perhaps they hope the town can sell the materials to fund an expansion into a city. Or perhaps they wish to bestow a noble family with weapons and armor that will last generations.

16. ""The Plaza of Gifts"": After a lifetime of hoarding, dragons want to give of themselves when the time comes and lands in a settled city's market square. The remains are turned into a massive feast, and the city is named in honor of the gift giver.

17. ""The Western Point"": A tall point over the great ocean. When dragons know their time is up, they head here for one last meal (the farmers all plow cattle and have a mysterious amount of gold coins.) One of the farmers have a +3 plough. The draw power from the local priest to sect the day of the flight, and pray to Bahamut for a good tailwind. On the selected day, they climb to the peak of the headland, launch themselves out over the ocean, and fly west until their wings fail them. 

18. Few have ventured in the caverns, but those who have claimed that even the air is boiling and that the dragons just lie there. None have been able to confirm the dragons are actually dead.

19. ""The Shadow Fields"": A swampy valley graveyard of a long-lived black dragon dynasty, the Brood of Killmagor, full of black dragon skeletons, protected by thousands of black-scaled kobolds in the surrounding valleys and mountains. Legend says that when one of Killmagor's brood dies in these deep, dark valley, their soul joins with the rest of their ancestors as a powerful dragon with multiple heads: Kil'Wrath, Protector of Dead Monarchs. Although there are legends of wealth untold under the ground of the graveyard, no grave robber would risk letting their skin melt off by the air for potential riches.

20. ""Grandma's Garden"": For years, an immortal being known only known as Grandma has been keeping dragons as pets. This pet cemetary has headstones hand-crafted by Grandma, each one taking centuries to make. Some dragons come here to die to be immortalized, just like their ancestors who were part of Grandma's family.

21. ""The King's Grave"": When dragons reach their final years, they tell their kobolds to dig a giant hole. On the day the dragon hears death, they enter the hole, has their kobolds surround them, say their last words, and have the kobolds bury them.

22. ""Library of the Dying"": This library was built to study the near-death wisdom dragons seem to possess. Dragons and The Library made a deal: Dragons would come to die there if their last words were written down and never to be destroyed. The partnership continues to this day.

23. ""A Friend's Lair"": Every dragon's lair has a special place for a dying friend. When a dragons is hours from death, they will fly to a friends lair, and enter that room. A dragon will take all time off of their day to talk to their friend for the last time, and having many dragons in your lair shows how kind of a dragon you are.

24. ""The Path of Adventurers"": Dragons want to die of combat instead of old age. So, when a dragon is near death, they race to a path well-worn by adventurers and have one last fight. Usually, the dragons tend to lose."

11. Lord Dimitri Elvale - The tiefling fellow is actually a devil of Demigod status. In fact they have a pact with a parties family member.
12. Claudius rainguard- sold his 9 year old daughter to a necromancer for the rights to a valuable mine which made him rich, now he is haunted by his daughters ghost and the only evidence is a receipt of sale hidden deep in his manor and that could topple his whole political standing.-

I realilty though, they're all gay. The marriage is a sham for convenience only. Lady Curval and Lady Dornhald are not related, and are in a romantic relationship. Lord Curvale hooks up with other closeted members of society at the Gentleman's clubs. The three of them run a successful business importing and selling rare books.

19. Sir Rayard Amberlain - Routinely submits a substantial amount of gold to a local wizard. The Wizard in question is a Diviner that is paid to spy on the noble's distant, heroic son.

22. King Roissaint Devereux - A reclusive king famous for wielding a magical sword, using it at the front line during wartime.

Many do not know he leads a program to educate the homeless and illiterate, and get them employed at his expense.

26. Juanita Arrazola - Many regard Juanita as brutish and a micromanager in her business dealings and those who report to her. Some of her success could be said is because of this behavior.

He has a face not even a mother could love, and a distinctive lack of prospects, wit, and intellect; is secretly illegitimate, totally and completely bankrupt, and without credit.

46. Duke Felix Simplissico - A incredibly stupid man, he is blessed with incredible fortune and luck. It seems that despite making the most idiotic choices, everyone turn out to give a good outcome for him.

He invested in a Ice Wizard transporting a small iceberg to his harbor and as it arrive, the worst drought imaginable hit his farmlands, allowing the iceberg to be used for irrigation and save his Duchy from famine.

He's actually the half-brother of both Lord Edmund Blackadder (through his father) and Lord Georgy Flashheart (through his mother). He doesn't want this getting out because, in his own words, ""I don't want to be associated with a pair of narcissistic gits. One who is as manipulative and conniving as a snake, and the other who possesses an obsession with the female form that even an incubus would consider unhealthy.""

52. Baron Algernop von Krieg - A mad scientist whose experiments are morally grey at best and completely obscene at worst. He created a light golem (a hologram golem, basically) so advanced that he was able to legally marry her. He organizes peasant shock fights (fights where two peasants are given gauntlets enchanted with shocking grasp) on a biweekly basis. And he works for a spy agency of questionable certification, questionable skill, and questionable sanity. But these aren't the secrets he's hiding. The real secret is that he may be a clone of the real Algernop von Krieg, who himself may have been a clone of High Lord Alfred Manx, the long-dead leader of the long defunct Einhorn Reich, an empire of human supremacists.

53. Count Jorge Malhon - A man who the kingdom pities for his awful luck in love. Married seven times, and widowed six times.

She loves everything about this house, except the shadow that seems to be following her. \[\]
69. Vincent ""Vin"" Benazir: Vin is not all there, and he never has been since they brought him out of the woods near his childhood home.

81. Royce and Mimi Metcalf. Mimi appears to shyly avoid conversation, hanging on her husband’s elbow and whispering in his ear coyly. In reality, she only speaks eldrich prophesy, and no longer communicates in human tongues. Royce carries on normally, bantering with others and smiling, but his mind is almost completely gone. \[\]
82. The Watcher. This well dressed bald man is just sitting watching the others. He isn't eating any food but is drinking water into which he drops a large tablet which dissolves before he drinks it.  \[\]
83. Bernalt Mason - A butler who is often seen at every extragavant party, serving the guests. Prompt, professional, and polite. No one is quite sure who his employer is, but he does his duties so well no one complains. In fact, it seems one can't even look him in the eyes at all. \[\]
84. Diana Evelyn Fawkes - A young woman blind from birth, sheltered in her family's manor from the rest of society.

\[\]

87. Maria Orosin - A violinist hired to play ambience music for the party.

88. Lady Imona Newport - A tall woman with a severe face and even sharper smile, who is always dressed in full sleeves and gown, even in the blazing heat of the summer. But if one examines her hands or neck for too long, one could swear there's something tiny, almost imperceptible, crawling under the skin. \[\]"
145,"I asked after this elsewhere and it doesn't seem to exist, although there are a few lists of dilemmas on r/d100, none of them quite fit the bill.

I have a few examples to start from. These are all adapted from [DREAD]( character questionnaire examples.  Each of them is either ""Why did you do B instead of A?"" (where A is the expected action) or ""Why do you B, if A"" (where the character is doing something despite a reason they shouldn't).  Essentially, why did your character do a ""bad"" thing instead of the ""good"" thing. I feel like this is an under-utilized technique for making rich, interesting characters, and would be a nice complement to the big question lists that are available on the web.

Obviously, a player will get out of these what they're willing to put in. An answer to 1 could be ""She's my grandma"", or it could be ""I don't know anything about her, but the kid's parents haven't been paying their protection money.""

1. **Why did you save the old woman instead of the child?**
2. **Why were you named after your cousin instead of after your grandmother?**
3. **Why are you working to undermine the young king, despite having publicly sworn fealty to him?**
4. **Why have you signed on for this mission, despite not having the recommended qualifications?**
5. **Why do your companions find you indispensable, and how are they wrong?**
6. **Why do you stay up so late, despite your early work schedule?**
7. **Why do you prefer long, boring voyages, awake and alone, to suspended animation?**"

149,"[Lets Build] d100 Minor Henchmen That Work Under The BBEG Or Their Underlings

Some simple characters that might have a small story behind them just to add a little personality to those faced in the heat of battle. They can also be characters that appear in special situations or locations depending on context. Be sure to include the character’s fighting style! 

This is a reupload  of the original permitted by. 

Let’s try and see if we can get this to 100!



1. The Conscience - A hired arm (or arms) that still fights the PCs but instead uses only non lethal attacks and will try to capture them alive. They try to follow their own moral code but in the end the boss is the one that puts food on the table.

2. The Gang - A group of henchmen that have gotten pretty close while working for the BBEG. They will usually all focus the same player and protect one another from the other PCs when they try and intervene.

3. The Nanny - This is one of those special situations. When captured the players might meet her when they put up too much of a fuss. The nanny mainly focuses in sleep spells and potions the keep the rowdy party of adventurers under control. If/When the players get loose they might meet a few more of her colleges on the way out.

4.  The Help - They usually tend to their master’s simpler needs but have a surprisingly in depth knowledge of the “higher class” forms of combat such as magic or fencing. When fighting the players they will usually say things like “I’m dreadfully sorry but the pay is indubitably excellent!” 

5. The Porter - Their sole purpose was to carry all the shit their master brought with them. They’re normally pretty strong but they just walked like 50 miles with 200 pounds of supplies on their back so they’re kind of done with this. They will sometimes try and throw things from their pack at the players.

6. The Ostentatious - A proud and arrogant fencer who will look for any opportunity to show off. They will single out the player that they believe is a worthy opponent and challenge them to a one-on-one duel in the heat of combat. Their coworkers are sick of his shit so they just leave them to it and will stop attacking the singled out player. If anyone helps the challenged player, The Ostentatious will become extremely angry and get an extra attack per turn.

7. The Norse - This goon is a firm believer in Norse Mythos and will make it known the moment they charge into battle. They are obsessed with the idea of dying valiantly in battle in order to go to the afterlife that awaits all Viking warriors; Valhalla. They will usually overextended way too far and probably end up being the first to die. All according to plan!

8. The Patriotic - This person likes the BBEG maybe a bit too much. They are extremely loyal their boss’s cause and will always look for an opportunity to show their faith. They usually aren’t the smartest spear on the rack (e.g. if captured they will suggest that they should be tortured for information and then boast about how impossible they are to break as they give information completely unprompted)

9. The Timecard - A ferocious spellsword, probably would be one of the most dangerous people in the BBEG's ranks if it weren't for the fact that he will stop fighting and head home the second his shift end. Even his immediate boss fears him a little, which is why he will negotiate rates with him rather than lash out at him for his behavior. He has enough work ethic to not allow himself to be bribed while on the clock. 

10. The Starscream - A sneaky guy, prefers to stab his enemies from behind, and his allies in the back. His ultimate goal is to overthrow the BBEG.

11. The Brute - Prefers to simply clobber his opponents. He is not big on brains, but is tremendously strong and durable. He also has a heart of gold and probably doesn't realize he's working for the baddies.

12. The Princess - Secretly the BBEG's daughter, she fights her father's foes with deceit and trickery rather than force and violence. Her favourite tactics include infiltrating the good guys by posing as a damsel in distress they need to rescue, or pretending to switch sides and join the good guys, only to double cross them. A natural seductress, anyone who falls for her charm and is enough of a pain in her father's eyes might find they are missing something in the morning.

13. The Fencer - A rapier-wielding swordsman who prefers to fight one-on-one duels. He lives for the thrill of battle, occasionally jeopardizing the BBEG's interests just to have a good fight and pulling risky maneuvres just to show off. 

 14. The Cheerful Fatalist - This guy is only too happy to get into combat and expects to die; he is looking forward to his afterlife for some reason (even though it will probably be bad). Constantly compliments the PCs on their choices and techniques (if successful) or offers advice (in case of failure). If captured he cheerfully accepts interrogation or torture.

15. The Entertainer - This one does everything with a flourish and is angered at friend and foe alike if upstaged or knocked out of their 'groove'. Constantly engages in attention-seeking behavior.

16. The Murderhobo - A character that believes they are in the right, even though they do reprehensible things like threatening, stealing from, and murdering other people. Offers righteous indignation if confronted with proof of their dark deeds. 

17. The Ambitious Henchmen - when fighting will do everything to the best of their ability but will often let the heroes go to kill the BBEG so they can move up, the BBEG either keeps them around to keep them in check or because they’re oblivious.

18. The Zealot - loves the cause the BBEG is going for, fully buys into it, often to a religious degree, even might criticize BBEG for lack of true devotion to the cause, tries to convert the heroes, works especially well on the stop the big evil creature from waking campaigns.

19. The Blackmailed - pretty much just what is stated, follows the BBEG because of information or perhaps even a treasure or something close to them, maybe if the party is strong enough they are promised their freedom or desired blackmail material if they kill the party.

20. The Tangential Ally - they literally don’t give a shit about the BBEG (often to their frustration) but follows them because they have something to gain and because they can use them to get things, stone cold, uninterested in the party and/or their conflict. Often caught using the villain’s resources for things barely related to them, sometimes for a twist can be the real BBEG.

21. The Lover - Harlequin-esque type, love can be reciprocated or the lackey is just being used, might want to kill the party to prove their love and/or devotion. Only rarely seen without BBEG. 

22. The Dreamer- has bigger dreams than the BBEG themselves and wants to fulfill them but the BBEG always stops them 

23. The Lennie and George - A small, fast talking creature and his hulking mentally damaged friend who follows anything that Lennie has planned. And in regard to the BBEG, Lennie has plan.

24. The Chef - Even the BBEG has to entertain and the Chef is a genius at cooking ""speciality"" dishes. As long as flattery keeps coming, the Chef keeps cooking.

25. The Desperate - they have nowhere else to go. No one has given them a chance to improve their lot in life before. Until now.

26. The Spy - the Spy is working to bring the BBEG down from the inside. You can trust him. He's definitely not a double agent. 

27. The Survivor - The sole survivor of a band of heroes. He's tricky to kill and only cares about living for himself. He will mock the heroes, but lose his composure if they bring up his dead friends. 

28. The Low Level side who is done with BBEG's shit: he starts out fighting the players, but will change sides in seconds of asked too

29. The crazy inventor: they don't fight the party, all the wild crazy automatons they built do.

30. Power worshipers: a tribe of yellow kobolds that follow whoever is the most powerful that they can find. They will change sides to help the party when they defeat the BBEG, on an intimidation check, DC 30-1/2 your level rounded down, or after a sufficient show of force (5th level spell or something)

31. Secret mastermind: the BBEG is only a puppet, and the party just ran into the puppet Master who works behind the scenes. They want to recruit or destroy the party 

32. The Sadist - loves to torture prisoners a little too much.

33. The Masochist - loves the BBEG's praise, but loves their punishments just as much.

34. The Quartermaster - in charge of organizing and distributing weapons and other supplies to other henchmen.

35. The Recruiter - brings in other minions to the BBEG's cause. Sometimes by preaching on a street corner, sometimes by starting up conversations with the discontented in taverns.

36. The Evangelist - constantly proclaims to other henchmen how wonderful the BBEG is and how lucky they are to hench for them.

37. The Kamikaze - lets themselves get blown up with a bomb, either in battle (like the running orc in Two Towers) or in some other critical location.

38. The Alchemist - usually comes up with the bombs and poisons and mind-control drugs. Can be in-house or freelance. 

39. The Necromancer - The Necromancer creates magical items and collects corpses for the BBEG's undead army. If the players double back to where a battle took place they'll see an odd old man tossing the dead into a cart. 

40. The Assassin - either trained by or hired by the BBEG, relentless and crafty. Marked by a thorough approach and flawless execution.

41. The Rider - Always fights mounted, usually with a strong bond with their mount. Perhaps a rejected knight or a nomad who got pressed into service. Bonus points for a unit of such characters.

42. The Messenger - For messages that must not be intercepted, the BBEG uses his own courier. Depending on the personality of your BBEG, can be either tight-lipped, magically addled or altered, physically incapable of delivering the message without a custom spell or method, etc. Can overlap with the Assassin, as they need to have similar skills.

43. The Junkie - their defining trait, at least at first, is their reliance on and seeking out of a certain substance or sensation. The BBEG keeps them in line with a steady dose of this. The party could even recruit the Junkie if they make a better offer. They could be cool and collected at first, with their composure fading the farther they are from their high.

44. The Bureaucrat - this henchman takes care of some of the finer details of the BBEGs schemes. Could be a treasurer doling out payment to mercenaries employed or someone in a government office smoothing over the roadblocks in the way of the BBEG. Patient and organized, morally grey. 

45. The Expert - A rather annoying henchman who speaks in a nasally voice, interrupting other henchmen and even superiors, on what they should be doing instead of what they just did. This henchman will immediately begin to fall back should they lose too much health and resort to ranged combat. If captured, this henchman often boasts about how they would never break... and then immediately begins to talk as soon as torture is slightly brought up. this henchman also has the unfortunate side effect of giving the PC’s advice, as well often interjecting with stupid, though honest, proposals in PC’s planning 

46. The Warlock- if the bbeg has powerful enough magic, one of their henchmen made a pact with them to do their bidding and gain some magical powers. 

47. The Mercenary - He's a muscle-for-hire working for BBEG as a guard or brute who has no qualms with the ethics of whoever hires him, which means he's also susceptible to taking bribes or even completely changing sides if somebody makes him a better offer.

48. The Miniboss - A leader in his own right of a smaller-time gang, this person has fallen in tow with BBEG because he thinks BBEG's agenda ultimately aligns with his own priorities. He likes to think that if things ever soured between them, he could still take his gang and leave, but in practice BBEG with all of his power and influence would probably never allow that. 

49. The Ex-Mercs: started for the pay, stayed because the BBEG actually seemed to care for them and paid bonuses above and beyond the contract for their good work. Offended at the idea that you could possibly pay them more or treat them better.

50. The Coddled Baby: This spoiled brat kid of the BBEG has never worked a day in his life. He rides on daddy's coattails and if you slight him in any way, his father WILL hear about this and it WON'T end well for you.

51. Very Very Nice Guard: polite to all the BBEG's captives, but don't take him for a fool. He's not going to risk the BBEG's wrath by falling asleep on shift, losing his keys, or any other standard escape trope. If you escape on his watch, it's because you've got friends breaking you out from the outside. The BBEG knows this and consequently trusts VVNG with a lot of responsibilities.

52. Big Bad Doggy: not necessarily a hellhound, could be any pup loyal to his master. This boi loves BBEG because of the belly rubs. And the steak. And because he's allowed to bite whoever the heck he wants. If you manage to Speak With Animals on him, that's all you find out. 

53. The Addict: Once an accomplished and honorable warrior, her addiction to a drug has degraded her skills and self-respect to the point where she's playing second fiddle for somebody she despises. She works for the BBEG either because he supplies her drug, or simply because she's burned her bridges with any better source of employment. She fights with elegant skill offset by drug-induced clumsiness.

54. The Bookworm: Nose is always in a book. BBEG is angry that he won't pay more attention to his surroundings, but he is really talented. If a fight starts, his first priority is not to lose his page, possibly going as far as keeping the book in his off-hand with his thumb stuck where he's at. If you start a discussion about books with him, he'll stop at almost nothing to keep you alive and talking.

55. The Keeper: An animal trainer paired with a supremely-trained and dangerous animal, who is the real combat muscle. She deeply loves her pet and values its life equal to her own.

56. The Sworn: He's only working for the BBEG because he was tricked into an ill-advised vow, and he considers a vow to be absolute, superseding all other morality. If you can find a way to get him out of his vow in a way that satisfies his sense of honor, he'll desert in an heartbeat. 

57. The Famous (Not) - Obsessed with the notion of his own fame. Pronounces his name with a flourish - ""surely you have heard of me"". In combat, will attempt dramatic moves, and volunteer for long-shot and dramatic duty, in hopes of gaining more fame. It's pretty obvious how easily he can be buttered up.

58. The Coward - yes, he can fight; no, he doesn't want to. People get killed that way! In combat, he tries to look busy, running around as if he's positioning himself for tactical advantage, but really focused on keeping safe.

59. The Crafter - her equipment is really intricately hand-decorated, and when you encounter her out of combat, she's probably carefully working on extending the designs. It doesn't really affect her fighting style. 

60. The Stooges; a group of comically inept, bumbling, walking disasters. They have good hearts, but misplaced loyalty. Will never be sent out on an important mission, but will still further the BBEG's plans better than the real mission. If the stooges encounter the pc's while out of the lair, the pc's will be captured comically easily through no fault of their own, but if the stooges encounter the pc's in the lair, all hell will break loose. 

61. The Cursed - Had some kind of curse set on them, whether by an outside force or the BBEG themself, and told that they will only be freed of it under the condition they work to fulfill the BBEG's plans. Would gratefully be turned if you can break their curse some other way.

62. The Gifted - Has some overbearing sense of magic or power that honestly frightens them or makes them ashamed. They might still be learning to control it. BBEG has either told them that they are too dangerous to exist anywhere else, promises to help them tame their power, or says that the BBEG will help them in using their powers for 'good'. Can be convinced to turn sides if shown that their power is more damaging on the BBEG's side than anywhere else.

63. The Beast - A lycanthrope (weretiger, wereboar, werecrocodile, werewolf, you name it) that, unlike most lycanthropes, very much enjoys the chance to unleash their full beast-like powers in combat. Could just have a taste for violence, or in reality have turned to the BBEG as a last resort after being shunned from so many villages. Depending on their personality, they might be hesitantly grateful or completely devastated in losing their lycanthropy. 

64. The Pillow Merchant - A very talented and charismatic merchant once devoted to the sale of pillows and other fine bedding materials. He also happens to be the leader of a small but growing Thieves’ Guild. He is looking to fake his death and escape to a new life of adventuring and treasure seeking. 

65. The Widow - a man once married who cruelly had his wife taken from him. He is well-respected among henchmen for his prowess at henching, but he has a weak spot for married people, and will take steps to ensure that either both of them survive or neither.

66. The Vampire Hunter - 30 years she's hunted vampires, for she is from a family of vampire hunters, and she's starting to think the family got them all cuz she's NEVER seen one. She takes all kinds of jobs, including henchman work, but she's got her ears open for rumors and whispers of vampirism . . .

67. The Passage - he can get you anywhere, without people knowing, in just about any circumstances. His mind is a steel trap for roads, maps, and where the secrets routes unknown to most. Surprisingly he's pretty cheap, but he is absolutely murderous if you slight him or insult his career choice.

68. The Weeb - he's not from that culture, he has little training or actual knowledge of it, but he's obsessed to the point of annoying all the other henchman and he attempts to dress and speak like he's naturally born into it. Frequently the other henchman ""prank"" him by dumping him in bodies of water because he never bathes.

69. The Akbar - usually represented by drawing a face on an ear of corn, the henchman call any non-sentient object with a face on it ""akbar"" and treat it as their friend. It can be really confusing to find out what an akbar is, because ALL the henchmen refer to him with warmth and respect rarely meted out to fellow henchmen, as if he was a popular officer.

70. The Jellyfish - he ate a jellyfish. This henchman is not understood well, and is cousin to one of the funnier henchman but they had a falling out a while ago. Since eating the jellyfish he seems to have lost his manners and speaks bluntly, but he seeks fame and sees the world differently and so the BBEG has uses for him.

71. The Screamer - she screams about everything. If she weren't so good at her job she wouldn't be tolerated. Happy screams for meal times, sad screams when friends die, scared screams for being startled, confused screams for complicated problems, gurgling scream for underwater, pitchy screams for singing, laughter screams for victory, girly screams for seeing friends after a long time, et cetera . . .

72. The Blessed - a person so beloved of a god that despite their actual level of skill, they succeed where others fail because their deity grants them the abilities to do so.

73. The Recruiter - part of the BBEG's HR department, this henchman is responsible for meeting staffing quotas, and failing to meet them is much worse than having to kill people who don't accept his recruitment pitch, so he'll do just about ANYTHING to get you to sign up . . .

74. The Honorable - a henchman who lives by a code. It doesn't always line up with the boss's, but the conflicts between them don't cause him a lot of undo stress, as part of his is following orders. He may or may not be reasonable if the party can convince him that the BBEG breaks the Honorable's code enough to override the part about of following orders.

75. The Councilor - a henchman of many councils. Not much for martial tactics, this charismatic evildoer revels in giving the best council, and works many schemes. So many that he cannot, under any circumstances, be trusted. Either the BBEG even has revelations, or the Councilor's schemes are ALL for him. 

76. The Foreigners - Pilgrims/Travellers from an exotic land wanting to make enough money to return home.

77. The Second Job - Local labourers just wanting to make some extra coin.

78. The Desperate - Beggars given a roof and some food in return for them being assigned the worst jobs as expendable cannon fodder. 

79. The Pet: A spoiled henchman who is favored by the BBEG. They may be a literal as well, with a collar and certain restrictions.

80. The Hedonist: A henchman who wants to enjoy all of lifes pleasantries. Slothful, greedy, gluttonous, lustful, with so many vices, they can be fairly easy to manipulate.

81. The Jester: A clown who seems to know more than they let on.

82. The Chameleon: A henchman who will can infiltrate any organization. May be able to alter their physical form.

83. The Gnoll: A henchman who is obsessed with blood and gore, but who is competent enough to NOT kill the BBEG (not yet anyways). Not necessarily a gnoll.  

84. The Starving Artist: Believes strongly that they are ""the next big thing"" in tavern music. Hangs around the BBEG for the chance to observe heroics worthy of immortalization in song and is always making noise on their lute/flute/horn. Took this job to pay rent.

85. The Conspiracy Buff: Joined the BBEG to fight the lizard people secretly running the local government. Willing to ignore all kinds of evil the BBEG does because ""think of the children"". Spends their off time running experiments to determine whether the Faywild is flat. 

86. The Quick-Wit — An experienced individual well known for their ability to innovate solutions to problems, and to cause them. Rarely goes in with a plan, but they can be expected to mostly follow orders, unless they see something to ""improve."" Often carries a weapon for many purposes, such as range, reach, stealth, and more.

87. Reliable Worker — Many villains want someone they can trust to get a job done as well as possible and consistently. The Reliable Worker is one who can do such. They may not necessarily agree with the BBEG or their methods, but they can be expected to try and do what's requested as best they can, and with frequently good results as well. Even if they routinely fail to beat the heroes, their relative success compared to others makes them worth to keep around — especially since they came back alive, with all the Intel that entails.

88. The Fanatic — While many underlings tend to believe in the BBEG's cause, few are as resolute. They believe in the cause so much, they derrive power from it (being a cleric or paladin), and likely value the cause itself over the BBEG, meaning they want to cause it's success by any means, even if it includes converting enemies, killing allies, or even replacing the BBEG if they feel they're ineffective at the job. They are a problem to manage, but a great asset to send upon your enemies if your resolve doesn't waiver. 

89. Joe: this is Joe. Joe might not be the smartest. Joe isn't the fastest. But Joe knows you have work for him. Joe knows what needs doing. How does Joe know? It doesn't matter. 

90. The Aware Mind Control Victim - some poor adventurer who has been Geas'ed into the BBEG's bidding. They apologize profusely but still attack hoping that they lose. 

91. That Guy (or the Nurse Joy NPC)- That guy is the guy who your party sees everywhere and no matter how many times they ask if they've met him before he says ""nah that was my (brother, cousin, dad)."" He's awfully friendly and interested in what the Party is up to. Secretly he's (they're?) reporting back to the enemy, be it a more minor Boss or a BBEG, on the party's movements, plans, and progress. Will the party figure out what's going on before it's too late? That is, in the end, up to the party, and their dice. 

92. The Last Nine - The sole survivors of their last BBEG boss, whose schemes came to a devastating end thanks to some meddling adventurers and their druid's beast companion. Fanatically devoted to the new BBEG for rescuing them.

93. The Lost Child - Uses manipulation to get people to help them and leads them into ambushes or traps.

94. The Scheduler - Very insistent that the crew stays on task, clipboard and stopwatch in hand.

95. The Brawlers - A rowdy band of toughs who cause bar fights or small riots as cover for the real action happening nearby.

96. The Butcher - Literally a butcher...but he knows how to get rid of a body...yes he does, he does.

97. The Cleaner - Did the other henchmen make a mess? No problem. The Cleaner is on the way.

98. The Clueless - Does a fairly important job for the BBEG, like accounting or logistics managment, but has no idea that they are working for the BBEG or what the details of the work truly are.

99. The Apprentice - Works side by side with the BBEG, learning the ropes, in hopes of replacing them someday, or at least opening a franchise.

100. The Librarian - Has an encyclopedic knowledge of things, particularly relating to the business. Uses their records, contacts, and research skills to provide intelligence to or for the BBEG. 

Honorable Mentions  

101. The Confidant - a respected advisor or sounding board (whether justified or not) who is trusted with the secrets, intrigues, and machinations of the monarch.

102. The Attorney - similar to a confidant, but has special expertise in relevant laws. Can identify rules that pertain to the situation in the involved jurisdictions, as well as loopholes to avoid those laws.

103. The Accountant - similar to the confidant, but the knowledge/secrets this person has are due to their involvement in the finances of the kingdom. They know all the income sources and every expenditure - including the specifics of those known to the public, but also the places the money goes of which the public (and the court!) knows nothing.

104. The Motherly Underling - A former mentor whose power has been eclipsed (that's why they're not the BBEG), but who is still a source of counsel/advise regarding affairs of the kingdom. This individual may have unwavering support, or they may be appalled by the trajectory of their charge after their training was complete.

105. The Incompetent Employed Relative (or SO) - this is a buffoon who is incapable of executing the simplest plan. They are in a position of relative power... because they are relatives. Whether it's the bonehead older brother, the girlfriend, or the son, the person in this position is a massive liability to the kingdom whether it's due to narcissism, stupidity, laziness, apathy, absence, or avarice.

106. The Attendant Healer - this is the personal physician. They may fulfill the role of counselor about other issues as well by virtue of the trust they have earned in treating the monarch for a life-threatening problem in the past. Their techniques may be conventional or bizarre, and their result miraculous or catastrophic. And they may have a conflicted interest as well....

107. The Hunchback or The Igor: A person who has been shunned by society for their appearance and/or actions in public, who goes to the BBEG, who treats them ""normal"" or helps facilitate their way of life so long as they serve them. 

108. The Hunter- Whether a vicious nobleman looking for the thrill of the most dangerous game, to a bushman with the decorum of a crocodile who eats what he kills, he has a near ritual method of ambushing enemies and a zero-sum hunt-or-be-hunted survival of the fittest view on life.

109. The Delegator- a slimy kind of charismatic and low cunning, this cloak and dagger type gets someone or something else to do his dirty work for him. Constructs, summoned extraplanars, manipulated or paid off bands of brutes, he can wrangle up anybody to do a hit but is useless by himself.

110. The Intimidated- saw what happened to the last guy. Will bail in the unlikely event he gets the chance.

111. Fail Manchu- uses assassination plots that are more complicated than foolproof that he just isn't capable of pulling off, usually involving poisons, venomous animals underarmed thugs, and overly-complex death traps."
150,"Trying to come up with original ways of conceptualizing the typical planes in a DND (or ""adjacent"")  multiverse This could either take the form of twists on individual planes, or theming the multiverse as a whole (if I especially like one idea I might post a list request to flesh that one out later if I cant come up with something too lol)

1. There are 22 planes, each inspired by the major arcana of tarot.
2. Each plane is based off of human emotion.
3. Each plane is actually the material plane at a different point in time. The feywild stand-in is a Conan/Primal-esque  world, the shadowfell stand-in is goth Fallout.
4. The multiverse is connected to a minimall, a train station, a library, or some other modern structure. The other planes can be accessed through doors, elevators, books, etc. and everything else is the same.
5. The feywild is inspired by the celtic otherworld, whereas the shadowfell is hades in greek mythology. These are pit stops to your actual afterlife, which include but are not limited to the rest of the planes
6. One plane is the memories/souls of a previous world, the other is the material components of said world, like buildings and technology.
7. The dark realm and the light realm.  In between is The Mists, where ghosts and the dead go. The Dreamlands is where dreams and the subconscious reside.
8. Taking a more contemporary pop culture understanding of it, the multiverse is literally just alternate realities with each having different aesthetics.
9. The gods exist in a realm that's effectively, if you took all the planes and layered them ontop of each other. It turns out *all* the planes are mirrored versions of the material plane. What's a mountain  in the material plane may be a giant skull in the shadowfell or a massive tower belonging to some devil in the 9 Hells.
10. The 9 Hells is a corporation. Mount Celestia has its own bureaucracy
11. The planes are actually all planets in the same solar system.
12. Each plane is the dream of a sleeping god.
13. The planes are all inspired by a genre of music, or maybe similar genres (a punk plane, a goth plane, a metal plane, a psychedelic rock plane, etc)
14. Some natural force (or malignant entity) is devoring the stuff of true reality. The planes are scar tissue left behind in these wounds /Qbit42
15. The planes are metastasis in some greater reality/being  /Qbit42
16. The planes exist as lenses onto a singular reality. Each one existing within the same physical space, interacting with it in their own way, but with existences distinct from each other. /Bargeinthelane
17. The planes are a giant cave system and each ceiling is a parallel dimension where everything is backwards. /Tricky_Hades
18. The space between planes is it's own patchwork world of various materials, structures, creatures, and objects that spent too long outside of a proper plane and became lost there. Best to make sure you have a clear path to your destination before leaving or you may find yourself trapped there as well. /LadyVague
19. The laws of physics/magic on each plane are determined by the beliefsnderstanding of a random sentient being in that plane, but no one knows that this is the case. Most people believe that the laws/rules are fixed. When that being dies, another being with similar, but not necessarily the same, beliefs takes over. Alternately, when the being dies, the plane, and everything in it, disappears. /equitable_emu
20. The planes exist as lenses onto a singular reality. Each one existing within the same physical space, interacting with it in their own way, but with existences distinct from each other. /Bargeinthelane
21. There is a substance left over from the founding of the prime material universe that can be made into real matter or energy by the dreams of sapient beings, or high-level non-sapient beings, such as dogs. The planes are all portions of one continuous dreamland. Some were first dreamed by gods in the days after the dawn of creation, some are the result of shared dreams of mortals, all are part of a loop where the dreamlands are a place the mortal mid visits and adds to during sleep. /BreakfastGrenade
22. Each star and planet in the sky is a demiplane. Some are (relatively) tiny places where a single god or titan might make a home, others would make the whole world look tiny and are homes to millions or billions of souls and living beings. Some of them are connected in constellations because they resonate with each other on the basis of alignment or some other energy, (in the same manner as the seven heavens and nine hells in the basic D&D cosmology. These constellations have an astrological effect on the magic and natural state of the prime material. /BreakfastGrenade
23. The 9 realms of the Norse: The realms/planes are mostly separate, but connect physically in certain places. It is possible to walk from one plane to another, but it is exceedly difficult to make the voyage. Permeating all of them is Yggdrasil, the tree of life. This can be substituted with the Weave for D&D /WolfOfAsgaard
24. Membrane universes: Based on an IRL theory that suggests universes are giant membranes or bubbles floating in a hyperspace in an ocean of bubbles. So not only are there billion of stars in a galaxy, and billions of galaxys in a universe, there are also billions of universes. Collisions could be an explanation to the big bang and for roleplay reasons, could represent opportunities to cross over to another universe. /WolfOfAsgaard
25. The omniverse is a beanstalk, each leaf its own multiverse / set of planes. /Tchrspest
26. The planes are physical locations that loop around, almost like a wheel. Shifting between realms is physical, almost as if you were going for a walk, but requires someone to know the way. If you don't know the way, you will not ever find the way. /MassRedemption
27. The 'universe' is actually a Dyson sphere and the 'planes' are different levels and regions within it. /bigvyner
28. The planes are the 5th dimension. Length, height, depth, time, plane. There exists entities that can travel through the planes as easily as you or I might walk to the other end of a room. /thebraveness
29. In the void between Planes lie impossibly ancient entities (nice opportunity for homebrew eldritch deities) the modern gods waged war eons ago before their ultimate victory and the creation of the Planes. /Sotra6
30. Despite the horror of existing in this void, in the 'sky' you can see all the Planes which I described as ""four dimensional galaxies of impossible colours"". /Sotra6
31. Plane planes: Each plane corresponds to the interior (and exterior) of an aircraft. Or is packed full of the aircraft. /techno156
32. The planes of flesh: Each plane is an cross-section-like slice of a living, multidimensional being. /techno156
33. The backplane: A backrooms-like location, where each room contains a plane in and of itself.
34. The planes of possibility: Quantum timelines, each spread out as a parallel planet of their own. Each timeline represents a single difference in one part of the universe. /techno156 Unified Verse: There is actually only one plane, spreading infinitely in all directions, dimensions, and time. If you walk, swim, fly far enough in a direction, you will eventually encounter another plane, with a slow transition between the rules of here and there. Gravity appears to be the only constant, in that it points mostly the same for all planes (that have gravity). /TheZintis
35. All is Time: All planes are the same, but they transition through time. Moving from plane to plane is but moving through large amounts of time. At one point all of existence was a void, then heaven, then hell, etc... /TheZintis
36. Macro/Micro: Planes are actually sizes of existence. If you manage to become big enough, or small enough, the experience you have is now of a different plane. The ""standard"" universe is but a tiny spec in the corner of another plane, and in the dirt beneath your fingernail is yet another plane. Traveling between them is actually changing sizes and position. /TheZintis
37. The regions of the Elemental Planes not completely dominated by their element (the border regions, aka what's usually referred to when you speak of the Elemental Planes) are created next to each individual world on the Prime Material, where the elements can combine. Effectively, each world has it's set of habitable ""pockets"" within each Elemental Plane. If you were to, say, brave the endless expanse of air in the Plane of Air with an airship, you could end up in the pocket of another world, as if you had travelled through space. /LucidCookie
38. The Astral Plane is not a shapeless silver sea where you can fly using your mind, but a a shallow sea, merely a few centimeters deep, with floor made of unbreakable stone, and the on the sky are colorful reflection images of the other planes. Although most of the plane is barren, you can go to determined places by performing standardized sets of actions. Travelling to a big city might require you to walk backwards from 6-7 minutes before saying a code phrase, while reaching a secret hideout might have a complex recipe that takes days to follow, and doing it wrong could get you in an unexpected location. Location recipes can chain with one another, and divination magic might help with learning how to get somewhere. /LucidCookie
39. There is no hierarchy between all planes. What is assumed to be the ""Prime Material"" is not the center of the multiverse or more important than any other. Planes connected to each other such as the Feywild/ Ethereal are still linked, but are all equally important and complex. /LucidCookie
40. The assumed hierarchy between planes is wrong. What is assumed to be the ""Prime Material"" is not the center of the multiverse or the most important, but is rather another adjacent plane to the true Prime Plane. /LucidCookie
41. Dreams take place in different planes, each corresponding to one creature capable of dreaming. These dreamplanes are very hard to access physically, and cease to exist when the corresponding creature dies. When physically inside their own dreamplane, creatures are immortal and omnipotent, as that reality is their to shape. Very few people supposedly were able to make this journey, and the ways to do it are wholly unknown, but it represents a form of immortality and godhood beyond lichdom or actual deities, even if it's kinda localized. /LucidCookie
42. The Infinite Layers of the Abyss, a seemingly endless group of planes filled with demons, is constantly trying to expand itself, as if led by a higher counsciousness. One or more of the Outer Planes is currently in the process of being assimilated by the Abyss, which threatens all of existence. /LucidCookie
43. Instead of the Nine Hells, there are the Endless Layers of Personal Hells, each personalized to a specific soul. Hells of powerful, long dead beings are larger and more well known, and hold most demons. /LucidCookie
44. The Planes are physically stacked on top of each other. The Prime Material is at the center, being bordered at the top by the Feywild, with the Planes of Water and Air above it, and the Upper Planes above them. On the bottom border is the Shadowfell, with the Planes of Fire, Earth, and the Lower Planes beneath. Only exceptions are the Ethereal, which overlaps the 7 Inner Planes, and the Astral, which exists besides and beyond them all. /LucidCookie
45. Inner planes devoted to scientific concepts such as gravity and magnetism exist. /FirstChAoS
46. A plane of magic touches all planes where spells can be cast. /FirstChAoS
47. A wilderness like spirit world plane overlaps the prime which is home to nature spirits and ancestor spirits. /FirstChAoS
48. The underdark is a separate plane reachable by going deep underground. The opposite, an over right, exists by ascending a mountains above the clouds. /FirstChAoS
49. There are only three alignment planes: good, neutral, and evil. Law and chaos clash for control. /FirstChAoS
50. There are five alignment planes. Good, evil, neutral, law, and chaos. Creatures with two part alignments can be found in both planes. /FirstChAoS

Edit: adding items"
155,"PCs are soon going to help a rebellion overthrow a mad dwarven king by attacking his palace. They're basically going to fight their way through the defenses to get to him and I'd like to find things for them to encounter. They're in a very large developped city so magic and such is very prominent despite dwarves being warry of it. I've thought the place to have all sorts of traps and automated defenses. I just need more precise things. I've also thought of having ghosts roaming around the place as the PCs have unvoluntarely awakened a lot of undeads Also the group is level 11 so don't be afraid to submit deadly stuff.

1. Iron Guardian: PCs meet an iron golem guarding the door to the treasure room. It asks for a password. They get 3 chances to guess before the golem goes into attack mode. The correct password is the name of the king's son.
2. Automated door: The corridor is blocked by an iron door. On it stands 2 crossed bronze axes that look exactly like the king's symbol. Uncross them and the door opens.
3. Abandoned chapel: A soft wind blows from a decrepit wooden door. Inside, a statue of the king's god lays broken on the ground.
4. Haunted corridor: Whispers resonates in a dark corridor. A figure passes ever so briefly. It says she's the queen. It begs for answers ! What happened to her ? Where is she ? Who are they ?
5. BBEG has an uneasy alliance with Illithids. Illithids and corresponding minions will assist BBEG dwarven king in defending the throne, only to be betrayed during the course of the battle. /GFWoWPRDad)
6. BBEG has made a deal with an evil Planar creature in exchange for the sacrifice a loved one or an item of familial, tribal or cultural importance. As above, the Planar creature looks for a way to renege on the deal. /GFWoWPRDad)
7. A mine operated by mostly non-dwarven slaves and/controlled earth elementals. A leader (avg. Party level + 2) runs the operation, along with several foremen (avg. Party level + 1) are spread out to maintain order, but will respond to calls for assistance from other dwarves /GFWoWPRDad)
8. An abandoned forge deep underground, inhabited mostly by creatures from the Plane of Fire. The forge is a failed experiment to harness the creature's powers to smelt ores. Most of the creatures are angry, as they are trapped and unable to return to their home plane. /GFWoWPRDad)
9. Fool's Gold - The party enters a room piled high with treasure, guarded by 1d4+1 guardsdwarfs. Little do they know, it is all worthless replicas -- all painted iron and tinted glass made to look like gold and precious stones. The guards don't seem to know the difference either. (Make a DC 15 Investigation check to see through the fakery.) /Zadder)
10. Music Box - before a locked door, the party encounters a pedestal on which sits a music box. It has the image of a key printed on its lid. Upon opening it, a jangly lullaby plays which summons a hostile ghost who holds the key to the door. /Zadder)
11. The ruins of the religious district. A group of ruined or deserted temples, haunted by ghosts of various fallen religious leaders who were executed by the mad king in his quest to seize the throne. /EthanS1)
12. The Artificer's Guild. The corrupt guild of artificer's who supply the army with automatons and other constructs. The guildhall is teeming with repurposed modrons and other attack constructs. /EthanS1)
13. The smelting pits. A long set of tunnels with conveyor belt floor that takes raw ore, breaks it down, and eventually dumps it into the forges of the city. Automated hammers and other crushing traps line the tunnels. /EthanS1)
14. Lava tubes below the cities' forges to provide heat for the craftspeople. If the tunnels are breached or diverted, then you have lava flows leaking into the streets, causing fires, smoke, laval pools, and other hazards. /EthanS1)
15. The Duergar quarter. The rough part of town, filled with a mix of lower class slums, ramshackle buildings, and dumping grounds from the upper classes. May not actually contain duergar, just used as a slur by the upper classes at the dwarves forced to live there. Filled by desperate dwarves who would not hesitate to resort to crime and violence. /EthanS1)
16. A group of freshly captured non-dwarven slaves shoved into a dwarf-sized cage. /911roofer)
17. A Hill giant they’ve chained to a waterwheel and forced to work has broken free and is searching for every dwarf who ever tortured him so he can squash them. /911roofer)
18. A cell full of prisoners with their legs chopped off and replaced with dwarven half-golem parts. They’re insane and will attack it let loose. /911roofer)
19. A room full of goods stolen from travelers haphazardly scattered. There’s gold, quality food left to rot, books, and maybe even a magic item. /911roofer)
20. The Darkiron guard, an elite dwarven troup with a roughless captian that has a tendencie to overthrow the King and become the dictator himself. The pary can ally him or fight him. /TheGentlemanARN)
21. The mad king killed his fellow dwarves and bound their soul to constructs that serve him. When the party fights a golem they will hear the sound of a mother looking for her child which is also transformed.(pretty dark) /TheGentlemanARN)
22. The dwarven king is mad on gold and has a giant tax ministry. Which is a distopia burocrazy. Dwarves need to wait ages to get an appoinment and need to give up all their belongings to pay taxes. All the dwarves wear long black ropes like judges and there is a giant juristic apparatus to charge tax evation. /TheGentlemanARN)"

5. A suit of animated armor that patrols a small village that occupies the ruins of a long forgotten noble manor. (by)

9. A former bounty hunter who is a dead eye with a crossbow. There's a long list of criminals with a grudge against him. (by Dungeon)
10. ""Wide-eye"" Wilma Vandal: This human female sheriff is often seen dozing on a chair in front of the sheriff's office, cowboy hat over her face. And yet, the town she's in is still relatively peaceful and any troublemaker who tries to take advantage finds out why. If any commotion rouses her from her beaty nap, without rising from her chair or even lifting the brim of her hat, she pulls out her sharpshooter from her seated position and caps the nuisance in a single shot, often bouncing shots off walls and objects to do so. (by)
11. ""Short-Fuse Sam""-araz MountainKicker: This town was positively crawling with No-gooders until this Dwarf stepped up and shot anyone who looked at him funny (incidentally lowering the crime rate).

158,"The party heads back to town for some recuperation and downtime after a successful adventure, but excitement and action are never far behind them.

These are encounters to keep players engaged even when doing something as mundane as renting a room. The five lists relate to five different price points for lodgings in an average town, each more expensive than the last. Each encounter should ideally be conflict and/or goal oriented and demand some level of creative problem solving. In general, lower end accommodations will involve unavoidable encounters with  downsides for failure, and higher end accommodations will involve  optional encounters with upsides for success. I've written them with the assumption that players might not all stay in the same place, hence the parenthesis to denote plural.

**For bonus points**, what kind of encounters would come out of staying at non-traditional accommodations like a temple or a guild house?  

 **Squalid: A crumbling and abandoned warehouse converted into a wretched tenement**

1. The PC(s) are forced to board with a small band of thugs who openly discuss their latest petty crimes and their next plans for mugging and burglary. The thugs will attempt to intimidate the PC(s) into silence and inaction. They will begin openly insulting and antagonizing the PC(s) if they are not confronted. 
2. A nest of rats has infested the building. The PC(s) notice them scurrying down halls and can feel them crawling over their legs as they sleep. If the PC(s) don’t deal with the infestation, they awake to find holes chewed through their backpacks and their rations destroyed. 
3. A pair of tenants loudly argue over money in the next room. If the PC(s) do not intervene, they will be awakened in the middle of the night by the sounds of one of the tenants in a destructive rage. The other tenant pounds on the PC(s)’s door, imploring them for help. 
4. The PC(s) can hear a tenant coughing and wheezing down the hall. He is bedridden and suffering from a serious illness. Sickness will spread throughout the building if the PC(s) do not cure or quarantine the tenant, and they must pass a constitution save or be stricken with the illness themselves. 
5. The PC(s) see a ragged young girl burst into the building and scramble for a hiding place. Two town guards enter shortly after, claiming to be searching for a pickpocket. If the PC(s) successfully hide the girl from the guards, she offers them a stolen piece of jewelry as thanks. It has a 50% chance of being a magic item. 
6. As a violent storm batters the building, the PC(s) are asked to help shore up its meager support structure. If they do not successfully fortify the building, a strong gust of wind will bring down part of the roof, pinning a hapless tenant. 

 **Poor:** **A meagre boarding house with creaking floors and drafty hallways**

1. A group of pilgrims have taken residence in the building. They ask the PC(s) for advice on avoiding danger in the local area and offer tales of far-off locations in return. 
2. An amateur musician with a broken instrument frequently practices in his room, filling the halls with his intolerable playing. If the PC(s) cannot find a way to stop or improve the music, they suffer one level of exhaustion at the start of the next adventure. 
3. A foul stench permeates the building. If the PC(s) cannot find the source of the stench and eliminate it, they will suffer disadvantage on constitution saving throws during their next adventure. 
4. The PC(s) overhear a tenant complaining of water leaking into one of the rooms. If they take no preventative action, they will awake to find inches of water pooled on the floor of their room and some of their items damaged by flooding. 
5. A local church has paid to be allowed to proselytize inside the building. Priests lecture the tenants on their habits and lifestyles and host sermons in the common areas. They offer holy water and healing potions to the most pious worshipers, but there may be other ways for the PC(s) to get their hands on those. 
6. A tenant goes from room to room feverishly searching for her stolen belongings. If the PC(s) do not help find the thief, their belongings will wind up missing next. 

 **Modest: An unassuming tavern offering shared bedrooms and a lively taproom**

1. A local peasant leader, militia captain, or crime boss sends their associates to meet the PC(s) and determine their allegiances and alignments. The associates will offer to set up a meeting between the PC(s) and their boss if their goals are in line . 
2. A small-time merchant strikes up a conversation with the PC(s) over a drink. If they answer her questions candidly, she will offer them a simple job related to their background(s).
3. The PC(s) share a room with a member of the town guard who snores and wheezes loudly enough to keep them awake. If the PC(s) choose not to wake him up, he will start murmuring a useful secret in his sleep. 
4. The tavern is taken over by a rowdy celebration with song, dance, and drink. If the PC(s) join the festivities, they will be approached by a shy young man trying to build up his courage to win the attentions of his crush. If the PC(s) can give him helpful guidance he will order an enchanted bottle of wine to the PC(s)’s table. 
5. A drunk guard captain is belligerently harassing staff and patrons. A barkeep mentions to the PC(s) that the tavern can’t kick him out without consequences. If the PC(s) can deal with the guard captain, they will receive free room and board for a week. 
6. The PC(s) notice a traveler from exotic lands in strained conversation with the bartender. Her knowledge of Common is very limited and she struggles to order a vegetarian meal. If the PC(s) can help her, she will offer them a distinctive piece of jewelry from her homeland. 

 **Comfortable:** **An immaculate inn with a prestigious reputation and many fineries available**

1. A local guild leader, military officer, or head priest sends their associates to meet the PC(s) and determine their allegiances and alignments. The associates will offer to set up a meeting if between the PC(s) and their boss if their goals are in line. 
2. The inn hosts a talent show for the entertainment of its lodgers. The PC(s) are invited to attend and to participate. The winner of the talent show is awarded an enchanted bottle of spirits. 
3. The PC(s) overhear two lodgers in a heated debate over a pressing political issue. One of the two asks the PC(s) which side they take. No matter how the PC(s) respond, at least one lodger will attempt to instigate and argument with them. 
4. As the PC(s) dine, a group of lodgers ask them to recount their most recent adventures for the entertainment of the whole room. If the PC(s) tell a compelling story, one of the lodgers will reveal himself to be a retired adventurer and offer them useful advice. Otherwise, he falls asleep in his chair. 
5. The inn hosts a meeting of the town’s influential residents to discuss recent developments in town. The PC(s) are invited to attend. One speaker criticizes the town’s reliance on disreputable adventurers for security instead of guards or soldiers, pointing out the PC(s) as an example. 
6. A small animal darts throughout the inn, eluding capture from staff. It seems to be trying to communicate with the PC(s). It is actually an alchemist who’s accidentally consumed one of her own polymorph potions. If the PC(s) can help the alchemist reach the antidote stored in her room, she will reward them with potions among her stock.

 **Wealthy:** **A exquisitely decorated inn offering every luxury imaginable**

1. The PC(s) are invited to an elegant masquerade ball being held in the inn. If they attend, a young woman approaches them for help. Her father is planning an arranged marriage and is intent on picking a fiancé from the guests at the party. If the PC(s) can successfully interfere or improve the situation she will offer them a handsome reward.
2. An irate guest can be heard insulting staff and making exacting demands in an argument with the inn’s proprietor or concierge. If the PC(s) investigate, the staff will explain that the guest is a woman of immense wealth and power in town and cannot be confronted directly due to her considerable influence. If the PC(s) insist on getting involved, the staff offer helpful advice on how the PC(s) could publicly embarrass or shame her.
3. On checking out, a wealthy guest announces that they lost a valuable piece of jewelry during their stay and that anyone who finds it is free to keep it. If the PC(s) want to get their hands on it, they will have to find it before the staff do.
4.  A group of brash, young aristocrats invite the PC(s) to their suite for a night of drinking. One of them puts his hat on (one of) the PC(s)’s head(s) and proposes to reward the PC(s) if they can stop him from getting his hat back. The only catch is that the PC(s) will have to do so with their hands tied behind their backs.
5. A famous and accomplished artist, poet, musician, or chef is staying at the inn during their visit to town. She confesses to the PC(s) that she is lacking inspiration for her next great work. If the PC(s) can inspire her, she will name her next work in their honor.
6. A circus troupe is scheduled to perform at the inn, but the troupe’s main act, a trained ape, has gone on a violent tantrum and is holed up alone in a room. The ape is trained not only to perform tricks, but to cast spells as well. If the PC(s) can get the ape back under control, they will be generously rewarded."
159,"I'm making a sci-fi campaign based on stories like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and Annihilation, so I'd love some inspiration for random things for my party to encounter out in the strangeness.

**d100 Things, creatures, and events to find in a Zone:**

1. A couple, seemingly frozen in time like statues. The woman is dumping a thermos of water over the man's head.
2. A hill that is also a lake: water flows *upwards*, coalescing into a sort of sheet that covers the entirety of the hill.
3. In the ruined remains of a storefront, there are dozens of razor-sharp shards of glass that, when stained with the blood of a living human, can see several 2d20 minutes into the past or future.
4. A colony of locals who were stranded when the phenomena began. They believe that the whole world has ended, and credit their survival to a mysterious artifact owned by their leader/s.
5. An oozing mass of human flesh, dotted with teeth, bones, sensory organs, and hair. If cut, it bleeds a thick, porridge-like substance that is nutritious, delicious, and highly addictive. Those who get addicted to the secretions find themselves totally unwilling to separate themselves from the ooze, and are slowly absorbed by it.
6. Your team wakes up at camp and realize they have spent 1d4 days worth of supplies and food, with no memory of what happened during that time.
7. A diner located in a forest clearing. It is empty, but fully furnished as if everyone had stepped out at the same time. Pleasant music plays from a jukebox nearby, and a delicious freshly-cooked meal, with enough food for the entire team, is sitting on the counter.
8. The team crosses paths with another investigation team, who are angered that someone else is intruding on 'their assigned sector'. They are not aware that they have been declared dead after being missing for three years.
9. A team member wakes up clutching 1d4 of their back teeth in their hands. If they search their belongings, they'll be found sewn into their clothing.
10. For 1d6 hours, the team's communication equipment picks up frantic distress calls from their allies/employers/contacts outside the zone, claiming they are being attacked, killed, and eaten by 'them'. After the period is over, communications resume as normal with those outsize the zone not remembering saying anything to that effect, or contacting the team during that time period.
11. Shards of glass that when stained with blood show the view from the eyes of the creature whose blood was used to stain the glass, this effect lasts until the blood dries. /Drofkcah)
12. A tunnel that leads out from the same place the party enters at the same moment back in time that they entered. As they enter the tunnel they invariably run into themselves leaving the tunnel and something is following them. /Brofromtheabyss)
13. A room with liquid about 3 feet deep filling the floor with desiccated animal carcasses on the bottom. Touching the liquid extracts all the water from whatever makes contact with it nearly instantly. /Brofromtheabyss)
14. A field full of what looks like foxtails, but each of the foxtail seeds on the head of the stalk is a burrowing parasite that tunnels into the parties flesh if they brush any off the stalk head and it sticks to their clothes. Closer inspection reveals all of the grass to be growing out of many corpses of humans and animals alike. /Brofromtheabyss)
15. Another party moving backwards in time, they can see and interact with your party but you each respectively perceive the other as moving and talking backwards, so meaningful communication is extremely difficult. /Brofromtheabyss)
16. an area of warped (or true) perception. Anyone within its borders looking out sees a warped and indescribable hellscape with anyone outside appearing to be horrifying abominations although the area and people within the borders seems normal. anyone outside the area looking into it sees the same warped hellscape and abominations but the area they are standing in and the people outside of the area also appear normal. /Brofromtheabyss)
17. As they drive into the small town they see a sign that says welcome to (insert town). then they blink and see a sign that says: Thank you for visiting (insert town). and the odometer shows they drove several miles... and it is 1.73 hours later.... and they have still warm cups of coffee that they definitely didn't have before If they turn around, the same thing happens in the other direction. The difference is the time. Each time they do it, it is a different length of time. And if you want to be really annoying, it actually says (insert town) instead of actually having a name. /Adventux)
18. 1d6 roaming huskies. They are neutral to the party unless provoked in which case they will attack (wolf stats). Can befriend by PCs with applicable skills. /VeritasVarmint)
19. A cache of canned food on a sled. 20% chance they are infected with botulism (if PCs eat they become poisoned). /VeritasVarmint)
20. A shipwreck protruding from rock. /VeritasVarmint)
21. The remnants of a colossal statue. Only a foot the size of a bus remains. /VeritasVarmint)
22. A room with dozens of pieces of curved crystal shards scattered across the floor. Every 10.6 hours the shards will begin to quiver then hop then fly around in a vortex to form a nearly complete sphere that rotates in the center of the room for 52 seconds. It then explodes back into the same shards again. There are a small number of missing shards scattered throughout the area. If all of the shards are brought back to the room, the sphere will reform, solidify, and float in the exact center of the room. The re-formed sphere can be shattered again. /Fluffy5789)
23. The party encoutners gravity creatures. Invisible to the naked eye, they can be discerned from the dust and miscellaneous debris that is pulled in by their gravity. They are roughly humanoid in shape, and their presence is accompanied by a deep bassy infrasonic sound, fluctuating with their activity. They are not hostile, and may be curious about the party. If a creature attempts to touch them, they are sucked into the creature's ""body"", the extreme gravity of which will crush/rip them apart. The creatures can be communicated with in a rudimentary fashion. They understand simple phrases, and respond by either making interpretive shapes out of debris or via gestures. Though most are roughly human-sized, they can vary in size according to unknown parameters. The largest ever observed was over 5 stories. It was easier to discern than the smaller ones, since its body space contained larger chunks of rubble, crushed cars, etc. Its mere passage pulled chunks off of structures and set things levitating. It could not be approached due to the intense forces at play, and it took no apparent notice of the research team's attempts to communicate from a distance. /Powman_7)
24. A room/corridor/path/alley full of masks that seem to be emitting a distressing scream causing intense paranoia. The screams however can't be heard through recordings or even by people unaware of the masks, as well as by animals. /Robosium)
25. The hunting grounds of a ""monster"", occasionally sounds of being followed can be heard by those walking through there and whenever they turn to look foliage moves in such a way that it hints at somethign dashing into hiding. There is no monster there. /Robosium)
26. When trying to open a door the one trying to open it falls into a temporary trance as they see a giant monster coming at them through the door. No one else sees the monster and the door isn't opened. Can be avoided by blowing the door up. /Robosium)
27. A street/road that gets more and more potholes the longer it is traveled until it is merely a mesh over a cavern. /Robosium)
28. In a damaged are of the city a bunch of eldritch mimics have disguised themselves as rubble, while small and weak they are nearly unlimited in numbers. /Robosium)
29. A glowing orb, those who look at it hear it but the sound doesn't make sense. Go ahead, touch it. /Robosium)
30. There's no shadows, everything looks as if it's under midday sun even if indoors, artificial light sources still cast shadows but it might be best not to do that too much. /Robosium)
31. A mysterious humanoid with an armored truck offering to exctract you. /Robosium)
32. A field stuck in a chunk of time, it occasionally rains artillery shells. /Robosium)
33. A basement where time passes a lot faster, not like you can tell while you're in there. /Robosium)
34. A semi collapsed metro station where trains seem to come and go, everyone who disboards one of the arriving trains collapses into dust as they step out. /Robosium)
35. An outpost belonging to the same organazation who sent you. The identification code that it has shouldn't come into use for another few years. /Robosium)
36. Yourself. Might be hallucinations, might be time travel or even alternate time line. Are you gonna trust yourself? /Robosium)
37. Humanoid corpses with their pupils replaced by growing voids, and their teeth either replaced with smaller, fractal instances of their own dentition, or a single solid monolith of enameled bone. /MaxSizeIs)
38. A chamber that was once filled with shining glass mirrors, that have shattered on the ground. Looking too long at the reflection inside the larger pieces leads to confusion, Gerstmann syndrome, and eventually complete madness, claiming they are on the wrong side of the mirror! /MaxSizeIs)
39. Living livestock with their portions randomly excised, with atomic precision, as if a giant pane of glass descended and sliced them in half. The creatures are just fine, however. Some of the portions match up with other portions, but across a long distance, and with no respect for original orientation. /MaxSizeIs)
40. Living and deceased relatives of current and former crew suspended on small hooks and strings from a chamber with a ceiling impossibly high and lost in darkness. All of those suspended are alive, and writhe in pain, calling out to any they see or recognize. They die shortly after being removed. A few have gone mad and are visibly gnawing on portions of theirs, and others anatomy. /MaxSizeIs)
41. A long, and subtly bending hallway, spiralling clockwise, and seemingly endless. The furthest any explorations have progressed is 128 kilometers. None can remember opening any of the countless doors that dot its length, and any footage of such is lost as static. /MaxSizeIs)
42. A chamber where there is only vacuum inside it, but no pressure gradient. A crew in pressure suits was sent in to retrieve the first expedition who entered, but they died when their suits [mysteriously filled with water]( /MaxSizeIs)
43. You enter a cave, which seems quite normal at first. About halfway through you notice that the floor is dripping water... towards the ceiling? At the exit, you find grass growing out of the roof of a massive overhang, light from below from a vast bright chasm. Upon closer inspection it's actually the world, but you and your party's gravity has reversed, and taking another step into it would have you falling towards the sky. /TheZintis)
44. The statuette looked pretty boring. A single carved glyph in a smooth piece of stone. You go back to the person who gave it to you, to find their body... growing. It looks like a clone of themselves is growing out of their body; pairs of feet, pairs of legs ripping their trousers, a second pelvis, 4 arms, two faces... side by side. They appear to be conscious, but the 2nd body makes them inflexible, unable to talk or really move. In horror you retreat, and notice your finger seems a little wider than before. Later that day you meet them again, with no memory of having spawned a clone. /TheZintis)
45. The village is small and quaint, and the people are very religious. They regularly attend sermons by the priest, who always stands by the altar when you see them, never moving from that spot. You are here to investigate the death of your uncle, and the only way is to dig up his corpse and find what the police refused to acknowledge. The cemetery is right behind the church. As you dig it up, you find that roots are growing through the coffin. To soon to be natural. You crack it open. Your uncles eyes are open, aware, his body entangled, consumed by the roots. You can hear the priest from the altar some 20 meters away, call to the townsfolk ""sinners! they defile our loved ones!"" before a mob begins to round the church. /TheZintis)
46. You inspect the lab, vials, samples, cadavers. But you hear something underneath the floorboards, a scratching, clicking. There's a trap door beneath the rug, that you pull open. Below is a dug out pit with dozens of large jars, the tops sealed. Inside moving hands claw at the glass, heads blink and chew, hearts beat, somehow all still alive. In the middle you find a doctor's kit, and within the kit, 3 vials and a syringe. /TheZintis)
47. The coppers nabbed you off the street and threw you into the asylum before you could get in a word. The orderlies manhandle you, straight jacket, and padded room. You scream for your lawyer, for help, till you give up and sleep. You wake up in the same room. The door is gone. There is a crawlspace behind you that you didn't notice before. It leads to another padded room, another crawlspace, and another room. In the 4th room you find another man, free of their jacket. They seem composed, and help you out of yours. You agree to keep moving, and in the 6th room you start to hear a din, a roar of voices. Instead of the 10th room is a huge hall, windows barred, tables flipped, and hundreds of patients, insanely screaming, jumping, fighting, dancing everywhere! Madness in their eyes! As you and your friend observe the mayhem, four inmates notice you and drag you into the fray. /TheZintis)

 "
160,"Things that happen can be interactive or just descriptive filler for the night passing.

1. You hear the stealthy noises of a preditor  skirting round the outside of the camp, investigating but not attacking unless attacked first.
2. Midges and insects decend towards the camp, biting anyone they can find. Con save or gain a level of exhaustion. Roll a nat 1 and contract a disease.
3. A large constrictor snake slithers through the camp, seemingly uncaring of your presence.
4. It begins to rain heavily. If the party doesn't have shelter, it seeps into the bags and ruins 1d4 of rations.
5. Hundreds of fireflies light up the night around you. It is quite beautiful.
6. You hear a loud crashing noise far off in the distance. It must have been something big for the noise to have carried this far.
7. As you sit watching, 2 large feathers drift down from above and land on the floor.
8. You hear dogs barking way off in the distance.
9. The moon comes out from behind the cloud cover, bathing the camp in cold silvery light.
10. A low lying fog creeps up all around and through the camp.
11. The campfire begins to burn low. More firewood needs to be collected/added.
12. You notice a number of small brightly coloured frogs. Survival check = they are poisonous. Dex check to collect toxin. Animal handling +Dex to befriend it.
13. Looking off to a watery flooded area you see bubbles rising to the surface. Investigation reveals it is swamp gas. Survival check = it is flammable. It can be collected in a jar or flask.
14. You see a glistening substance oozing down the outside of a tree. If investigating then roll a d4. ....it is a sweet sap that is edible and nutritious. Collect for 1d4 rations. ....it is poisonous. Can be collected but Dex check to avoid any damage. ....it has a small live animal trapped in it. (Frog, mouse, bird etc) animal handling to save it. It can be befriended. ....it is an ooze creature. Roll for initiative.
15. You spot clawmarks on nearby trees at head height. Survival check = this is one way large preditors such as bears and big cats mark their territory.
16. You hear a splashing, squelching noise as of something coming out of the muddy water. Roll a d4. ....it is a zombie hand....it is a baby crocodile....it is a large frog....it is long tentacle feeling aruond on the bank, then it disappears back under the water.
17. You see a constrictor snake thrashing about as it wraps itself around a small crocodile.
18. You see something that looks very much like a humanoid hand sticking up out of the water and mud. From this distance you can't make out any details. Investigate with a Dex check to avoid damage from difficult terrain getting close enough to see it clearly. Up close it is obviously just a twisted dead branch.
19. You notice a leech attached to your leg/arm. Then you notice another and another. They are all over you and your companions. Need to remove them all or suffer damage from bleeding due to anticoagulant in leeches bite.
20. You spot some clumps of fungus. Roll a d4. ....they are edible. 1 d4 rations....poison....they start screaming loudly if you go near them.... They have medicinal properties.
21. Staring at the tree across from where you sit, you see a pair of socks rolled up and stuck in the crook of a branch. Perhaps someone has used this place as a camp before?
22. A strange eerie howl echoes out across the night.
23. Whilst on a patrol round the camp edge you see a tree with some initials carved inside a heart on it.
24. You see a nocturnal predator eat a sleeping prey. Whew! At least it wasn't you! /storytime\_42](
25. You hear distant chanting. You can't quite make out the words, but there's something distutbing about the rhythm /Gwyon\_Bach](
26. A huge insect the size of your hand lands on your friend's head while they are unaware of it. [**MaxSizeIs**](
27. Someone in your party discovers a heretofore unknown hole in their boot, after stepping on something sharp (that shouldn't be) and then getting wet. Their foot has a wound now, better hope it isn't gangrene or worse... [**MaxSizeIs**](
28. The ""dry"" ground rolls and swells with a small wave as something.. somewhere, moves the muck near your party. It seems what you thought was dry ground is actually a high-floating mat of peat. [**MaxSizeIs**](
29. One of your party suffered the unlucky fate of the ground beneath their tent oozing muck. Now everything perishable they own is soaked and possibly ruined unless special care. [**MaxSizeIs**](
30. Care must always be taken to search yourself and your teammates for parasitic infections immediately when making cap while there is adequate light to spot the small signs of the little bastards. Failure could lead to sickness or worse. [**MaxSizeIs**](
31. A dense, low rolling fog settles in, in the low lying areas. [**MaxSizeIs**](
32. A gas-pocket beneath the muck nearby ruptures, releasing foul smells.  [**MaxSizeIs**](
33. You notice snake tracks. Judging by the size, you are too small to even be a snack for it. [**Jaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn**](
34. Off in the distance, glowing figures dance and howl. Upon closer inspection, they are revealed to be luminous (glow-in-the-dark) monkeys of some sort, worshipping the moon. They do not take kindly to outsiders. [**Jaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn**](
35. ruins of what was once a stone structure rise out of the swamp off the side of the trail as the water level goes down at night. It appears to be a circular structure, like a corner tower of a fortress, or a perhaps a mage's tower that once towered over the treeline. [**Jaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn**](
36. A light smolders in the distance, dim enough to not be immediately noticeable even at night. If you move to inspect it, you find a freshly made campsite. It's abandoned, but there's still smoldering coals on the fire, the soup hanging over it is warm, the beds are made but unmessed, and there's traveler's gear for a party just slightly larger than yours. However, there are *no* tracks of any kind. [**Jaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn**](
37. for 100 yards, the mud of the swamp changes to scintillating yellows and blues as the stars come out. [**Jaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn**](
38. In the shadows, it appears that a humanoid figure is watching the camp in the distance. Instead, it appears that someone's making mud statues into theater style scenes in the swamp. You see an island that looks like an execution of a monarch; a bunch of dwarves on the edge of a quicksand pit hacking at ogres being swallowed in the muck; a goblin fleeing a group of caravan guards by running across the water while the mercenaries get bogged down in the muck; a love triangle between a fairy, a devil, and a giant; and a mass of children tipping over a fat merchants cart. All made of mud. [**Jaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn**](
39. Is that a ghost??? Nope, just a random lightly colored quilt blowing by in the breeze. [**Jaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn**](
40. a whirlpool starts up just out of sight, making tons of disgusting and suspicious squelching noises. [**Jaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn**](
41. the crocodiles are horny tonight and won't shut up with their mating calls. [**Jaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn**](
42. the swamp to the south suddenly explodes into flame! A gout of burning swamp gas releases from the swamp, and this phenomenon continues throughout the night. Hopefully not to close to the camp . . . [**Jaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn**](
43. gunfire erupts, but there's no flashes and no smell of gunpowder. Investigation reveals a species of tree that expels spikes at high velocity with chemical reactions. It nets the party a freshly shot herbivore unlucky enough to try to harvest this particular plant. [**Jaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn**](
44. A cloud of gas, whose coloration is noticeably different than the rest of swamp, seems to be patrolling off in the distance. If it notices the camp it'll settle on the party, and it's SUPER hallucinogenic. It's not evil, it just finds flesh creatures hilarious when they're high.  [**Jaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn**](
45. You feel dozens of stinging sensations and are alarmed to realize that the location you are sitting is infested with ants.  [**kkngs**](
46. A series of gloopy,, squelching foot steps approach, getting louder and louder. When the sounds seem to be coming from no more than a few feet away, a bullfrog plops up out of the muck and croaks loudly. [**OwenMcCauley**](
47. In the distance, a murder of crows suddenly starts into a loud ruckus, calling and cawing for almost a minute before stopping just as suddenly.  [**DustyBottoms00**](
48. you catch a glimpse of something's tail just as it dives into the muddy water, something big.  [**zabananzoan**](
49. You notice all the things that hop, that crawl, that slither, glow or chirp in the night migrating in the same direction. Following their trail, lit by fireflies and glow worms you see in the distance they are converging at one point. In the center of a body of water you see the source of their focus; A druid is channeling them, lit up by the full moonlight.[**SortByGnu**](
50. The smell of death rides on a brisk wind and blows out your campfire. You realise that what appears to be an uncountable number of eyes have appeared glowing in the dark, staring at you.[**SortByGnu**](
51. The night is thick with fog but you can notice in the distance what appears to be another campfire. Once you arrive at it you realise that it is your own campfire that you just left. Behind you can't make out where you came from but ahead you can see through the fog what appears to be another campfire. [**SortByGnu**](
52. A thick fog begins to cover the ground. You are unable to look further than 10 ft. until noon.  [**notNoiser**](
53. A necromancer and ""girlfriend"" taking a stroll thru the swamp with his bat familiar.(a friends old d&d character. he grew up in a swamp.) [**Adventux**](
54. There is an avatar of the god of death walking past your camp if you investigate it will tell you of a battle or ambush that happened recently near by and give info about the participants
55. One member of the party dreams of a fat, lustrous, orange moon laying low on the horizon, only for it to be swallowed by a ... thing ... from the depths of the swamp. They are awakened by the nightmare, only to see the moon low on the horizon just as in their dream. [**MaxSizeIs**](
56. One member of the party dreams of being inside a beautiful field of wildflowers, that grow slimy tentacles that try to entangle them. They wake up to find the tent has leaked on their bedroll and their wet blanket has wrapped around them like a snake. [**MaxSizeIs**](
57. A random member of the party finds a slimy creature has taken up residence in thier boot. The boot (non magical) is likely ruined and will need to be replaced. [**MaxSizeIs**](
58. The fire seems to fall unnaturally low, the flames turn a sickly chartreuse colour, and when whoever tends the fire throws a log on the fire or messes with it in any way, they must pass a Difficult DC Nature check, or the fire erupts 1d4+1 *Burrowing Worms* se the Burrowing Worm Attack from a *Spawn of Kyuss*) against a random player each. [**MaxSizeIs**](
59. It starts to rain... blood. Only for a few moments, but the muck and everything else is stained with the filth. The next morning, only the items the party tried to clean are stained. [**MaxSizeIs**](
60. Without meaning to, the party finds the partial skeletal remains of a humanoid in or near their camp, that they missed the first time searching. They seem to have died in chains, or bondage of some kind, and by violence. [**MaxSizeIs**](
61. An Easy-Medium DC Investegation check of the camp deveals a shallow pool nearby filled with 1d10+1 fossilized teeth from an herbivore. Each tooth is at least 6 inches across, and weigh 15 pounds each. They might fetch up to 1d10+1 gp each to a collector.  [**MaxSizeIs**](
62.  Naked and afraid are filming the next episode of their ArcanaVision program. [**LucidFir**]( 
63. A strange pale insane goblin, or maybe it's a halfling? Is making it's way past on a log muttering about rings and ""thier precious."" It has a cursed ring of invisibility on it. [**sirkibblesnbits**](
64. Baby goblins are gathering toads in order to lick them. If interacted with, they will ask annoying questions and try to set flammable things on fire. [**sirkibblesnbits**](

162,"Here are examples of cultural expressions and practices, taboos, and such, authentic or which feel authentic, to breath life into real world historical settings or make low fantasy settings more ""grounded"". You may specify the context

Please specify if they are actually historical or pseudohistorical. By pseudohistorical, I mean a claim not backed by a source

1. (Pseudo) In medieval Europe, killing a naked person was considered the epitome of cowardice and treachery. Saying that someone could kill a naked person was an idiom to convey contempt for one's character.
2. (Pseudo) The concepts of daytime and nightime were different, as there were no such thing as business hours. People would wake or go to sleep at random times.
3. (Pseudo) Nudity was scandalous not due to an immediate association with sexuality, but with abjecy poverty. Moreover, people usually had sex partially clothed.
4. (Pseudo) Parties and social gatherings would last for several consecutive days. There were, however, no such things as birthday parties.
5. (Pseudo) Fire was extremely hazardous and having a light required extensive control and permission. A ""fireguard"" of sorts had to stand guard and accompany whoever requested it. Kitchens were extremely well-guarded and cooks would often have heated arguments with these guards, as they accused them of disturbing their work.
6. (Pseudo) Scolding other people's children was a widespread practice.
7. (Pseudo) With no regular military or security personnel, guards would work for several people. They didn't even need financial gain, they would do whatever advanced their own interests or suited their fancy

14. (Pseudo) All newcomers to a town had a specific district to dress and undress, and had lockers assigned to their belongings. Changing clothes anywhere else was considered a punishable crime. A lot of the social life of this city was something akin to ""locker room"" talk.

Historical: While there is no formal central authority figure responsible for it, every member of the community is considered responsible for the maintenance of a particular part of the local infrastructure (roads, dams, walls, fishing ponds, whatever).

163,"### What system of magic powers your fantasy world?

*Please be consise with all your super cool ideas <3*

1.	Soul Magic - Only those with souls can perform magic. The more you use magic, the more your soul fades away.
2.	Tarot - Divination based Tarot card magic. The cards help determine future actions.
3.	Geomancy - Interpretations of random figures or markings, paired with astrological interpretations.
4.	Creature Summoning - Pocket Monsters… but not trademarked!
5.	Cultivation - Meditation and martial arts, often with the long term goal of enlightenment and immortality.
6.	Ego / Reputation - Your reputation as a Paragon or Renegade defines what magic you can perform and your strength of ego defines how powerful it is.
7.	Progression - Working to level up and increase martial or magical powers. Usually paired with a video game leveling system.
8.	Moon magic - Magic based on the moons and their waning phases and celestial locations. ""My girlfriend turned into the moon.”
9.	Sorcery. Relatively weak spells that can be altered and “stretched” in different ways by the skills of the caster.
10. Runic magic. The Rune Magician acquire knowledge of individual elemental runes (i. e. Fire, Water, Earth, Time, Dark, etc.) And combine them with various form runes to create magical effects on the fly. Runes may be invoked in many ways including writing, chanting, dancing, etc.
11. Prayer. Priests invoke magical effects by praying to their deities.
12. Spirit magic. Spirit magicians (shamans) command various spirits in their thrall to serve them with magical effects.
13. Alchemy. Alchemists use the inherent properties of natural and magical substances through the processes they’ve learned to create potions, elixirs, and powders of power.
14. Enchanting. Enchanters spend weeks, months, or years creating items with permanent magical effects.
15. Thaumaturgy. The Thaumaturge uses the principle of identity to manipulate the world around them. For example, by manipulating a splinter from a wooden structure, they can affect the entire object.
16. Vivimancy. This is the magic of life. The Beastmaster gets their power from the connections they have with animals. Their familiars help and serve them in all sorts of ways.
17. Herbalism. Plant magic. The herbalist cultivates and hybridizes plants to create magical new cultivars with strange powers.
18. Energy. Magic draws energy from one’s surroundings. While the life/atmosphere in these surroundings can reaccumulate over time, excessive use of magic in a single area without giving it a chance to reaccumulate can create “dead zones” that make it much harder for a magic-user to pull in energy.
19. Gold/alchemy. Gold has inert magical properties, and by performing a ritual on it it can be transmuted slightly to activate these properties. Gold excells in directing one’s energy/will into the world. As such, mages often possess gold accessories relevant to how they prefer to cast spells. Someone who uses a lot of hand movements would likely wear a gold ring, while a more vocal spellcaster might wear a necklace or even have a tongue piercing. A bard may use a golden pick or wear golden bangles if they prefer to dance. Even wands and staves often have golden cores.
20. The source of magic is a mystery that is debated over and those who practice it don’t know it’s true origin.
21. Small multicolored four legged creatures that people call Faeries, Devels or Daimons. They follow you silently appearing from behind rocks or trees or cracks in walls and are too quick to catch or kill. If you offer an open hand they will crawl into your palm and transform into a magic coin. And refuse to elaborate. Each coin is inscribed with sigils that if written down have no meaning but can be read. Some see them as powers that can be obtained and they invoke the sigils in their mind to make the coin vanish and a mark to appear on their hand, granting them the power of their chosen sigil. Some see them as symbolic of their gods, and a way to commune with them. They use their coins as talismans to conduct rituals and receive oracular visions. Some distrust the coin and refuse to study it’s sigils. They found that when struck each one emitted a distinct tone, and by harmonizing with it the coin would turn into a loop of magical thread. This thread can be wrapped around weapons to make them indestructible or incorporated into instruments to give their music hypnotic properties.
22. Necromancy - the manipulation of both life and death energy. Master necromancers can restore life with a touch just as easily as they can take it away. Commonly misaligned due to its’ overuse for malignant ends, a powerful lich is leading an initiative to rehabilitate its’ image in favor of one more benevolent.
23. Animism - the world is filled with spirits of every kind, though they are usually asleep. Animism is the art of rousing the spirits to wakefulness long enough to get them to do what you want. More advanced animists can even control elementals, spirits who have forsaken sleep for extended periods of time.
24. Demonology/Spiritbinding - the art making pacts with otherworldly beings. Spiritbinders bind spirits or other beings to themselves, gaining a measure of that being’s power in exchange for acting as a host and providing them a way to interact with the mortal world. A spiritbinder may not be as powerful as a conventional mage, but they make up for it in sheer versatility, able to bind the right being for the job.
25. Warlockry - Warlocks derive their power from a mysterious source that gives them power that ordinary wizards’ can only dream of, but also extracts a price for each usage of it. Each time a Warlock uses their power, they begin to feel a mental compulsion to perform some sort of act as payment. These can be as simple as smoking a cigarette or as debilitating as breaking your fingers. As a Warlock grows in power, they also begin to feel the influence of the Call, a mental summons to visit the power source of their power. As they get more powerful, the Call becomes stronger and stronger, until it is too powerful to be ignored. All Warlocks who answer the Call vanish without a trace and are never seen again. Smart Warlocks will use their powers to amass as much money as they can before moving as far away from the Source as they can and never using their powers again. Of course, Warlockry is incredibly addictive, so only Warlocks with the strongest of wills are able to accomplish this.
26. Quantum / particle physics. Descendants of one tribe of magic users can align the particles in matter to make it stronger and more durable. Descendants of a warring tribe can release energy as chaos, typically for throwing fire. With the right methods, both can be used for treating wounds and disease, while having too much order or chaos in your own body can be dangerous. A select few descendent from both tribes can use both aspects. (The Saga of Recluse)
27. Music / song. Music from instruments can be used as power for magical, with different instruments focusing on different effects. Trained singers can focus that power into more specific effects as described by the lyrics they sing. (The Spellsong Cycle)
28. Matter manipulation. Users of this system of magic can move or shape matter into different forms, provided that a source of the matter already exists nearby. The most minor abilities can be used to shape objects, for instance rearranging a nickel into two dimes. With training, users are able to add energy into the mix sually for creating and throwing darts), while advanced used are able to manipulate energy directly (bending light to create invisibility or sucking heat out of an area to create ice). (The Imager Portfolio)
29. Unified Magical Field Theory - Magical flux flows through the world and is analogous to magnetic fields on Earth or the Sun. The flux vortices spring from constantly shifting points on the globe and reenter at other locations. There are a few fixed points in the realm like Stonehenge, Pyramids, or ruins like Machu Pichu. The flux’s maximum power is at solstices and equinoxes; Druids tied their calendar to the cycles. Spellcasters can accumulate manna by “charging” in the proximity of a vortex. The closer they are to the center of the vortex, the faster they recharge. One can wear a talisman “manna battery” which they use when low on manna, or are too far away from a vortex. Manna is spent in proportion to the level of the spell, and the number of those affected by it. One can combine their power in rituals, and high-level spellcasters can tap the vortex by acting as a conduit for the spell manna required. This is risky because they can lose control and their powers are lost and mind is “fried”; or they inadvertently open a portal to other planes of existence and get “sucked” into the vortex."
164,"Hi everyone!

I’m trying to build a list of knights/fighters that the PC can meet in a town, a tournament or even on the road.

They don’t necessarily need to follow chivalry codes but have to stand out, be famous, feared or accomplish something  no one else could have.

No particular rule/guideline.

The Blades, the most powerful fighters/knights of the kingdoms:

&#x200B;

1. The high king protector, a tall bald man with a strong face, a white beard, wearing a white and gold armor, old but can still kill in a second. have served for three kings, and none of them died by sword.
2. The needle , great fencer, travels the kingdoms to enter all the greats tournaments , ladies favorite and for reasons. Isn’t welcome in a few kingdoms because of that.
3. The sword to hire , an ex-royal-knight, who built his own village/little kingdom with his gang, building a mercenary army. The higher payer is always right.
4. The grip, famous to always declare a deathmatch in tournaments, and strangle on the ground his disarmed and broken opponent. He did lose some fights though, but got a strong neck.
5. The Guard-hero, he was the protector squire at a time, and still on his ward, he’s now the 3rd army marshal, leading to victory while fighting on the front line between his soldiers. He also won all the tournaments he attended.
6. The auroch, at fifteen he was already the height of a cherry tree. The army noticed him and he became an important asset. He wield a claymore that would take 4 guys to barely lift and at his sight a lot of well trained soldiers turn into deserters ( or dead bodies).
7. The errant, a tall bulked guy, with ungroomed facial hair, a bun. He got a huge painted pavise that covers all his back. He seems a little rough but is the definition of loyalty. His kingdom has fallen but never will his pride and sword.
8. The scarlet rose, a woman but a deadly one for sure. Raised in a knight family, she took it personally and trained twice as much as everyone . Many mens that ran after her petals ended in a coffin. they still refuse her entry to tournaments but if she wears a big-ass armor, who’s gonna recognize her? eh !
9. The banished , to become an outcast when you were a hero you need to do something really severe/stupid. A sword on the road always ends in someone's mouth ( sounded better in my mind…). But a dirty sword can still cut and hope for a fine clean.
10. The Knight-King, being a king is cool, but fighting other pretendants to the throne to reach it, is badass. His subjects acknowledge his strength and soon will his opponents.
11. The Hammer, from a blacksmith family, he purchased components, made a warhammer of them, tested it and made sure people knew it was the best. One day ,some detractor sayed to his face that a hammer is just a vulgar weapon and the way of the blade was the only true, I think he nailed it.
12. The dancer, most knights use a shield to block or prevent openings, he didn’t need it, guessing the way of the blade just by listening to it, like a song. And with an empty hand he just fought adding a sword was a good idea. It was.
13. The Eboni helmet. This knight always wears an unmatching black helmet with a red feather. The legend says the helmet is empty, since the guy doesn't talk really much. But his blade speaks for him and the crowd will answer.
14. The reed Knight, coming from the far East, some say that his technique is unconventional, illegal,  a cowardly one. But the way his blade passes through even bones, not even letting a single blood drop escape, shows the training, the will and the way of the blade he swore to follow.
15. The half knight, The twin brothers were famous to be equally skilled, linked by an unbreakable bond. They shared each fight and victory. But when one of them crumbled, the remaining was purposeless, his loved rival gone. With time an dht help of his brother wife he recovered.He still fight for two and devote all his victory to his fallen brother.
16. The Ghostblade: A giant of a man who wields a 10ft blade single handed. So named not because of his ash white skin, but because the whistling of his blade through the air sounds like the screams of the damned. -Kahzy
17. The Block - Most knights use a shield to complement their weapon. This knight, on the other hand, has garnered infamy by solely using their immensely heavy stone shield as their weapon of choice.
18. The Knight of Tusks - Wears a big helmet with two big tusks jutting out of his forehead with padding so he can headbutt fools who get too close (the boar's head is over his own). He fights with an axe and actually works for the church and is an ordained priest, being quite devout.
19. The Chevalier du Lac - A weird freak of nature. Dude just turned up one day in a wheelbarrow saying he was a knight. Didn't have a name or know where his kingdom was - he just said he came from Lake Longmere over there. He only had a beautiful, white plate armour decorated with webbed parts and things like that. He then proceeded to stand on the main road to the kingdom and duel every single knight - and win - until the king relented and made him a (bachelor) knight. The guy is a daredevil who throws himself in danger in search of adventure; he's not stupid or even a dick, but he seems to have a hyperfocus on this without knowing why.
20. The Old Snake - A duke-knight who's pushing 70. First feast he went to as a knight, everyone got shot with crossbows, he was the only one to fight his way to the door with the leg of a table; second one, people were poisoned, he cut open his own guts to remove the poison and somehow didn't die. Since then he seems to refuse to die. He has been shot at with arrows, people have tried to murder him with poison and knife, he has been in countless wars, and he doesn't have an eye. Somehow he just doesn't die.
21. The Hunter King - An old king with a prodigious moustache who constantly hunts the illusive white hart. Atop a horse, he's next to none in power, but he seems completely uninterested in ""civilized"" life, preferring the company of magical and strange things. Has a penchant for musing on the nature of life.
22. The Orange Knight - A dude built like Hercules - huge, muscular, and constantly without his shirt. He was kind of a douchebag until he fought with an orangutan. Him and the ape noticed they were gonna kill eachother if they kept doing that, so they found a strange kinship and started a friendship. The Orange Knight became less of a prick afterwards, but now he walks around with the damn orangutan everywhere. (Possible add-on: the orangutan is a knight who got cursed and found a new purpose in the Orange Knight, they may be gay for one another)
23. Firstborn of the Clan of Garloth - A powerfully built dude who hails from a clan from a rugged land, masters of barren hills (or sand dunes) who have had to toughen up to survive and expect an iron king. The Firstborn *isn't* that. He's a showman who likes wrestling and yells move-names, and he's actually a really good fighter, it's just that a lot of people find his methods to be crude and embarrassing. He doesn't give a shit though.
24. The Vermin, an individual disfigured by the same toxins present on their stiletto styled daggers. Now cladded in a patchwork of leathers and light metals covering all of their skin, they fight in a manner proper to them only, often killing in a single prick on the skin of their ennemies.
25. The Peace Maker - A strong woman wearing iridescent plate armour that preaches for peace. She will try to solve everything with words, and will draw her sword for no one but the ones who chooses violence as their first option. She believes unconscious people wont fight and therefore will be peace (she isn't wrong tho).-Grimoire
26. The Lost Guardian - A simple looking man in his 40s wonders through the forest looking for his apprentice that vanished out of the blue a couple years ago. He fights monsters and thieves with a beautiful cerulean rapier while asks for adventurers on the roads about his student's whereabouts.-Grimoire
27. The Sorrowful Bonekeeper - A mysterious person that wears a red mask with a crying face and a long nose. They finish off anyone suffering on death's door, humanoid or monster, and collect their bones as a religious ceremony or try to heal those who still have hope on living. They communicate only through hand gestures and whistles.-Grimoire
28. The Swineherd- A large, shirtless man covered in scars including one which runs diagonally from an empty left eye socket downward to a partially missing upper lip. He keeps a particularly nasty large wild boar chained to his right hand and a large, rusty cleaver-like sword in a nearby trough filled with slop. He holds no title or official authority, but the locals defer to his wishes partially because of his mean temper and partially because of the delicious pork he provides to the town at reasonable prices.
29. The Duck Knight - A tall, broad and imposing figure. He wears dramatic armor with faint motifs of wings and waves, the burnished metal a dark copper brown. It is scarred with the dents and chips of many battles. A strong dark brow and steel blue eyes are visible behind the grate of his helm - the rim of the helmet above his eyes subtly but surely shaped in the fashion of a duck's bill. He carries a heavy two-handed greatsword, strong enough to prop it on his shoulders. Fights to the death unless facing an opponent he respects.
30. Hermannus le Noble, a man with a curly mustache and fancy curly hair dressed in fantastic gilded armor and brandishes a large sword and shield. He carries a strong french accent and will brag about all his accomplishments with anyone that will listen. He will offer to do impossible challenges to upkeep his name and honor. He uses the knight's code of chivalry to take circumstances to lean in his favor and make himself look more noble than he probably actually is.
31. The Dark Knight. Wears a black suit of armor and an impressive cape. No one knows his true identity and he speaks as if he suffered an injury to his larynx at some time in the past. Known for brute strength, cunning, ingenuity, and a good-is-not-nice mentality. Has a coat of arms with a bat emblem on it. Also has an extreme distaste for decks of cards, particularly jokers.
32. The Silent Knight. Wears a red suit of armor and sports a crazy white beard. Rides a chariot pulled by deer instead of a horse, but is completely mute. Seems to always have some item relevant to the current situation on hand.
33. The Shade- A Shadar-Kai who was once an Arch-Fey from the Fey Realm. After suffering corruption and manipulation from Lolth however he fell from grace and lost his status. He wondered aimlessly searching for a purpose when the Raven Queen offered to bring him to the Shadowfell so long as he promised to serve her faithfully. He agreed and was taken to the dark plane where he realized he was only being twisted and corrupted again though this time by a different force. Many centuries later he still does the bidding of the Raven Queen, but seeks an end to his imprisonment and will do anything to step outside the Shadowfell again.
34. Master Chef - a knight whose singular purpose is to dine on the most exquisite ingredients imaginable. Dressed in pure white, wielding an unnaturally large cleaver, and chef’s hat. This knight has be known to use a victim or two in their cuisine.
35. The Cloud Chaser: virtuous, chivalrous, and delusional. Ths knight has been seen fighting farmers scarecrows thinking they are monstets, chasing clouds thinking they are dragons, and assuming a librarian was the bishop.
36. The Knight Watchman. A mysterious figure who has lots of watches and clocks incorporated into his armor. No one knows who he is, where he comes from, or where he goes, but he is reputed to keep an eye out for those in grave distress. He is also said to escort the dying to the afterlife.
37.  The White Knight. A young knight who overcompensates for his own perceived deficiencies by pursuing a code of chivalry to the fullest extent possible. Known for being a champion of the causes of women, children, and the seriously ill.
38. The Knight in Shining Armor. His armor is exactly what it sounds like: Polished to reflect as much light as possible. Vain and glory-seeking, but used to taking a beating for the same reasons.
39. The Breadwinner. Used to be a farmer before his farmstead was destroyed in a war; he was drafted but took to arms quickly. Extremely humble due to his upbringing and circumstances. Always happy to provide advice, particularly on fighting or farming, and can often be found ministering to the poor by preparing and handing out food.

165,"# d100 ""Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra"": In-Universe Cultural References that Only Nobility Would ""Get"".

Fantasy Nobility has significantly more resources for learning, and incentives for keeping the class-based power-structure, leaving commoners in ignorance.  Class based power structures often develop codes to separate High from Low.  In real-life terms, Victorian and Edwardian, English-speaking scholars occasionally used their knowledge of the Greek or Latin languages, myths, and literature to discuss ""sensitive"" subjects in front of prudes.

1.  *""The Rain and the Legion""* A foreign tale of an invincible red-armored general leading a legion of troops is improbably taken down by a seemingly insignificant detail; a single, tiny raindrop; surpassed any sword that faced him.

1.  *""Remember Wise Livius Singing""* Leave the Acting, for the Actors, and the Singing.. for the Chorus.

1.  *""Voiced Like Tyrrhenian Horns""* Ironically Shrill and Weakly Bodied.  News  or an Idea that doesn't Go Over Well.

1.  *""A Brown Bull""* Even Commoners would have heard of The Brown Bull of Cooley, but Nobles take it as a Tale About Alimony, the Importance of a Full Accounting, and to avoid situations that result in Mutually Assured Loss.

1.  ""*Courage has a Brutal Core.*""  Unironically, 'Break a Few Eggs.', 'Weep Later'.

1.  ""*The Ass Eating Thistles*"" Miserly.  'You Can't Take It With You.""  Ironically, Failing to Recognize the Potential Value of Your Schemes.  Likening a rich man to an ass that, though it 'bears on its back costly victuals, he's a pauper who feeds himself on brambles and tough reeds'.

1.  ""*The Wood Has Ears, The Field Has Eyes*"" Beware the hootings of the 'Owl of False Wisdom' as the old poem proclaims.  Don't think yourself wise.  Alternatively, 'Shutup, the servants can hear you.'

1.  ""*Weigh High Wycombe*"" Embezzlement. Growing Fat on Misappropriated Funds.

1.  ""*Never Since of Serpent Kind; Lovelier*""  Rarely is the entire quote used. 'Beware of plots and plans, as beautiful as they may be.'

1.  ""*Of Turnus for Lavinia Disespoused*"" Unhealthy Passion or Zeal in Pursuing a Dangerous Path. A Dangerous Liason.  Poor Emotional Control.

1.  ""*Give the World to See Again An Untouched Pallas*""  Fate Sealed.  The Consequences of One's Actions.

1.  ""*Long and Tedious Havoc Fabled Knights In Battles Feigned*"" Get to the Point.

1.  ""*May Singers Repeat at Noon That Which is Recited at Dead of Night*"" Discussing Reputations, Good or Bad, and Manipulation of Such.  An obscure quotation from an ancient epic poem (that many nobles forced to learn a dialect of Celestial are forced to memorize) praises an ancient demi-goddess, now extinct, titled: '*The Exultation of Inora*"", occasionally speakers will use the title as shorthand for this concept, instead of the quote.

1.  ""*Invite the Gentleman Into the Cauldron*"" Trapping Someone with Their Own Strategy.  Ironically: Discussing one's own plans and plots carelessly.  Also: ""*Please Enter the Urn.*""  From an old Imperial tale in which the Majordomo orders the Spymaster to confess to treason.  If one is being particularly obtuse, they may speak the shibboleth: ""*King Jung's Roux Wings*"" in deliberately mispronounced Old Imperial.

1.  ""*Remember Old Jarvie*"" the First Earl Admiral of Maeford.  Depending on context; Appropriate Application of Justice during Various Troubles or Mutiny; The Folly of Disrupting the Established Order of Things, and Succeeding Too Well; or Hubris in Announcing the Impossibility of Something that is Indeed Possible.  A historical study of a noted and accomplished figure in the Admiralty, noted for pursuing a somewhat strict sense of justice, folly in dogged attempts at 'modernization', and in the latter, declaring an enemy invasion vector as unlikely due to historic defensive patterns.

1.  *""Will You Follow Duke Mu to the Grave?""* When one falls, often one takes others with them.  From a particularly bloody time of the Ancient Empire, when royals made sentient blood sacrifices to the gods upon their deaths in order that they would have servants and slaves to serve them in the afterlife.

1.  *""The Lion in Winter""* When the Fall is All There Is, It Matters."

It took them 4 hours to ratchet it back up, poor fellow was nearly asphyxiated in there, I'm sure it'll drop their IQ by a few points, they were always an insufferable prick lording it over everyone, maybe now they'll be tolerable..."" /MaxSizeIs]
75. Corporate ramped in-office AR overlay ad-placement rates up to 80%, but dropped it to 79% for some reason. That 1% of extra AR workspace released has really helped productivity! /MaxSizeIs]
76. IT accidentally revoked the handshake certificates for nearly half of the bio-ware enhancements used by the staff in the office, but locked the passcodes behind a handshake enabled bio-ware authenticator.

81. Having to get cybernetic replacements for the limbs they lost in the office-furniture-moving accident. Their limbs are now on lease. /TheZintis]

102. The company has forced employees to park in paid public parking for a year while they renovated the parking lot into a parking garage, giving more parking spaces and better protection of employee cars. Only once the construction is completed, it is found there is now even less parking than before as they have sectioned off many spaces for management/corporate parking and the upper levels are now a helipad (or two) for when important visitors fly into town.

104. The company recently installed a new program that keylogs and records all employee desktops. However, the machines are not high enough quality to run so many intensive programs on them, leading to sluggish work stations and crashes.

170,"Inspired by Runehammer’s D4 timer die from Index Card RPG: Add tension to combat encounters by rolling a D4 at the beginning. Each round of combat reduces its count by 1, having some complication happen when it gets to zero. The danger can be unknown or out in the open.

An example from Professor DM here: [

Runehammer himself: [

 

1. Reinforcements arrive, flanking the party.
2. An alchemical procedure is interrupted by the group, in D4 a horrible reaction occurs, causing a reaction that produces a deadly gas cloud. (Change up whichever effect as needed.)

4. Spell of summoning is completed, something from the hells will arrive.
5. A hostage will be sacrificed to an evil deity.
6. The enemies flex and shake violently,their skin splitting open with a strange green glow coming from within. It's clear they have been subjects of some kind of unholy experiment. They now do double damage.

96. Medusa's head is revealed by the boss, everyone must take three constitution saves or be turned to stone. You must fight blind to avoid this effect.

100. Space warp: Each turn 1d4 of the enemies randomly swap positions with the same number of players.

EDIT: Great response from everyone. I’ve added what there is so far with some edits here and there to help flesh things out. I’ve left out some ideas as the theme is more of complications for the party than boons. Boons would be considered “Treats” in ICRPG which I’m considering creating a separate list for. Per ICRPG, a fun encounter should have the three “T’s”: a timer, a threat (monsters), and a treat (something to help the group). But I digress; as of now we’re almost to 100!

EDIT 2: We made it! There were a few ship oriented items so I will create a 1d20 ship specific timer table as well when I get a chance. Post to follow soon. This is what I have so far:

Random Ship Timers:

1. The ship will sink.
2. The ship will crash into the rocks (Or iceburg)!
3. The ship flips over or to the side, sending everyone over that isn’t able to hold on to something.
4. One or more giant squid begin to attack the ship.
5. The ship gets sucked into a whirlpool that transports it to another plane or location like a wormhole.
6. The ship will arrive at a hostile bay if the enemy isn’t defeated and the course is changed.
7. The ship sails into a storm, whipping it about, obscuring sight, making the ship difficult terrain as it tilts back and forth. Each turn rolls a dex save to keep upright.
8. The ship catches fire. Must be put out before the black powder ignites.
9. The ship’s mast collapses, dex save to avoid it falling on you. Deals deadly damage on a fail.
10. The ship sails into a doldrum, no wind or current to be found, causing any ship that relies on sails for movement to come to a stand still. 
11. An enemy galleon/giant ship comes in range.
12. The ship veers within range of Scylla and Charybdis.
13. The ship veers within range of the tempting voices of the sirens. Wisdom save to avoid being drawn towards your death at the rocky shores nearby. "

31. A small shrine made of wood, with a glass door in it that shows a rolled-up letter inside of it. Breaking the glass makes a huge hostile creature appear to defend its shrine. Finding the 'pure' way to open the glass door gives access to the mysterious letter, which is written in an ancient language.

38. A massive clearing that appears to be the hunting ground for massive bipedal birds. These creatures consume rotted flesh and thus use their massive stature to skewer prey on tree branches to ripen in the sun.

At one point the survivors of the crash seemed to have transformed the cabin and loose planks from the wreckage into a tree house of sorts. Much of the home lies undisturbed.

52. A huge animal skull shaped rock/fossil that turns to look at you when you aren't looking
53. Nearly invisible webs dangle to the ground. If touched, you are instantly stuck and reeled to the canopy 100 ft up where a colony of spiders lurks.

55. An inviting cave to spend the night (perhaps with a lit or pre-build fire) is actually the fleshy inside of a hungry giant snapping turtle. 
56. A fine morning mist creates rainbows. Strangely they reach the ground and, while temporary, are solid prismatic walls. 
57. During a heavy rain, the trees, plants, and ground of this forest floor are covered in a group of poison dart frogs. A single touch could kill or incapacitate and while not deadly, the poison sticks to your clothes and tools increasing risk later on. They can be harvested for poison. 
58. A group of dinosaurs have begun eating fermented fruit and are very drunk 
59. A grove of plants are coated with real functioning eyes. Besides being creepy, they are harmless. What is not harmless is the pair of eyes belonging to a creature hunting you that hides amongst them.

61. The morning mist of this stretch of forest becomes so magically thick you start to drown

64. A group of small marmosets seem to be hunting insects with primitive tools. They must be strangely intelligent but run and hide from you and refuse to communicate.
65. Huge pillars of pale stone, the tops are carved into statues of great heroes and kings. Oddly, all are merfolk 
66. Lava pours from a small volcanic formation, it burns and covers the land with new rock. Strangely, the rock immediately starts growing exotic fire resistant plants (possibly from the plane of fire)
67. A massive crystal clear pool of water under a tall but gentle waterfall. It looks inviting to swim and rest in. There is no trick, it is almost magically soothing and everyone feels rested and wonderful.

69. A sudden downpour that ends as quickly as it started, but leaves a thick mist that reduces visibility and makes navigation even harder. The rain starts and stops like this all day. The rain blinds you and makes terrain slippery. Within the mist, navigation tools like the compass fail to work properly. You are getting hopelessly lost.
70. There are massive cave and tunnel networks where the roof looks like the night sky due to glow worms.
71.  Naturally occurring, beautiful terraced pools. A great place to rest and swim. Other creatures seem non-hostile as they cool off in their own ponds, as long as you don't approach their pool
72. A massive temple complex that is overtaken by plant life. Despite it's origins, it now hosts natural lifeforms that feed, hunt, rest, and sleep in the complex.

174,"I'm making a D&D character generator and want ideas for character backstories. They don't all have to be serious, they can be as weird as you want. Try keeping them pg 13 please. Thank you!

1. After years of abuse and torment, this character snapped, killing both their parents as well as a few innocent bystanders by accident. Once seeing the damage they caused, they ran away, and trained to become a fighter, hoping they can make up for what they've done by killing things that truly deserved their death.

After many years of failed adventures, they form a party with the wrong group, slowly turning their ""adventures"" into crimes. After their SO dies, this character spend time alone. Then this character realized they now had what others around them didn't: a motivation to do good with experience and connections with the city's criminal side.
3. An abandoned halfling, taken in by a family of orcs, grows up in their environment. Their mom being a barbarian, they feel the obligation to follow in his footsteps. Not taken seriously by anyone except their family, they form even more motivation to succeed.
4. Growing in the most suburban part of the world, this character loses touch of the wild.

They are still getting used to what the world is truly like

(from r/DnD)
6. Frustrated at being a magician's apprentice, this character got his ""big break"" when his master was commissioned to create a very deadly poison. He used it to kill the master, then took his magic items and scrolls, and is now pretending to be a mage.
7. A two-bit thug stumbled upon an ancient ritual, a path to power, and sold his soul. Unfortunately, he did not sell his soul to a demon, but to a celestial. Now he is required to be a hero. He will be find redemption, whether he likes it or not!
8. An old dwarf worked most of his life as a blacksmith, owning and running his own forge. He lived a long, but incomplete life, secretly harboring a rather gnomish urge to make machines and trinkets. His wife passed, his children and grandchildren were old enough to run the shop without him, so he decided this was his chance. He donned his armor, grabbed his hammer and hit the road, searching for inspiration to build newer and better machines.
9. There where always two of you, since you have had memory. Always two, hunting, feeding from the land and living free. But you now found yourself in the city, alone and afraid. And you ponder...Where's your other half? Why did it left you... and more important... did it really exist?
10. You wander alone in to the town. Eyes unfocused and lips sealed. In your hands, the severed head of late friend... or was it a foe? Hard to remember... Perhaps those people can help you...
11. Your son and daughter are old. Both have their own families and responsibilities. In a moment of remembrance you find yourself thinking about your late partner... you feel lonely. But... There are no more responsibilities holding you back, maybe it's time to pursue the old dream... half a life of adventure is better than nothing you think.
12. The death of their family to war had motivated them to become one of the most feared generals of all time. But they were on the losing side. To avoid capture they changed their face and tried to mingle with the commoners. Their new community hurt their heart, “these were the people I had been killing for so long?” Though they are rusty, they embark on a new adventure, eager to redeem themselves
13. The kids have grown up, have jobs if their own, and the spouse gave me their blessing. I can finally go back to my childhood dream of going on a grand adventure. I should send postcards back home of all my adventures.
14. You were drunk, blacked out (whether it was a first time drink or one of your usual benders). When you come to, you find yourself joining a party going on an adventure.

Your loving family became everyone in the temple. Eighteen years after your Abandonment Day, you were given a sealed scroll, cast out, and told not to return until you accomplished your task. The scroll commands you to steal the infant princess of a neighboring kingdom and return with her to the temple to join your family.
16. You had everything someone could want. A spouse, a child, a home, a business. You were loved in your community and weren't doing bad financially either. But your memory only goes back for about a week. You don't know who you are or what happened to you prior to one week ago. No memories of parents, childhood, anything. You must regain your memories and figure out what happened.
17. You grew up with stories of heroes, magic, and villains. Every tale, every myth, every rumor, you've heard. You've spend hours in the library reading, or in the taverns listening. Every story ends the same though, with the heroes winning at the end of the day. Even after great losses or a thousand years, the heroes always win. Being obsessed with these stories, you want to try your hand in creating one yourself. One where the heroes might not win for once.

So, you decide to have a bit of a teenage rebellion phase, even if it's a few years too late for it. You divorced, quit your job, and go on the road to find your own life.
20. You attempted to steal from a dragon's hoard. Instead of killing you on the spot, they listen to your plea first. You explained how you needed the money in order to get aid for a sick relative.

22. From your birth, the local seer kept announcing that various events from your life were portents of a great destiny and a heroic fate for you.

All you wanted was a quiet and ordinary life, but the weight of expectations upon you was unendurable, so you left home in hopes of outrunning your reputation for impending greatness.
23. The daughter of the local potentate had a romantic fascination for you. The fact that her interest was one-sided did not assuage her parents, who are convinced that your ""not interested"" act is just playing hard to get to fire their daughter's ardor even further. Their harassment has escalated to the point where staying home would be impractical and maybe fatal.
24. Your lucky day! You found a hoard of gold coins. The image and name engraved on them are... yours. Your curiosity won't let you dismiss it as a weird coincidence; you have to find out how this happened.
25. Your childhood love, the one you expected to grow up and marry, announced years ago that she was bored, and left to seek adventure.

26. You were a camp follower, making a living selling goods and services to soldiers. Recently a drunken regimental leader traded all his armor and gear to you in exchange for another cask of wine. You knew you finally had in your hands your best chance at making a fortune of your own, so you got out of there before he could sober up and demand to undo the trade.
27. On the eve of your respectable arranged marriage to a boring, wealthy, and painfully appropriate spouse, you were kidnapped. Thank God, finally something interesting! Except it turned out your kidnappers planned to have their way with you. So you left, taking some gear and leaving some corpses, and now your only specific plan is never go back home.

Your father raised you to believe that only the line of the Old Kings is legitimate, and when the lost heir appeared to claim his throne, you and your father were proud to stand in his front ranks. After the defeat, you fled for your life. Now you're torn between rage at the current king for killing your father, and rage at your father for throwing his life away on a hopeless delusion.
29. Old family legend says that your line originated in a vaguely-described faraway country. When you were found to have a slowly progressive disease that will one day kill you, you sought out advice from a seer, who told you that a cure can only be found in your lost ancestral homeland."

Submissions 6-17

6. Jousts - Straight up.


7. The Pig Trick - Don't ever describe it. Witches do it, they need a pig and space, and it's inappropriate around children, although very funny.


8. The Rope Trick - A conjurer throws a rope up in the air, it gets stiff, he climbs it, and when he reaches the top, he vanishes. He later appears climbing out of the rope from the ground.


9. The Light Urn - A small goblin inside a rectangular box of metal with a glass hole quickly draws an extremely detailed portrait of whatever the hole points to. There are tiny curtains that the owner pulls with a tiny lever that opens for the lil gremlin-thing.

12. The Inverted Pool - A merman, mermaid, selkie or whatever is appropriate for your setting sits in a pool of liquid. A target is next to them. When the target is hit with a ball in the bullseye, a small cage of piranhas is opened, compelling the merman to quickly jump from the pool to uproarious laughter.


13. The Wind Tube - Magicians put sigils on the floor that release a lot of wind, basically creating a tube of wind. Ballerinas jump on that and do dances with ribbons in the air.


14. Clowns! - Because everyone likes a good laugh. Optionally, the clown can be a shapeshifter that walks around imitating you but making you look fatter or thinner and doing practical gags.


15. Sheep / Dog / Monkey Fancier Competitions - Bring your best sheep, dog, monkey, or dragon to make very fun tricks and be admired by the entire town. The older champions sit by the side. No grades are given, but if the champions smile and say ""there it is"", that's about as much acknowledgement one can be expected to get.


16.The Hat Trick - Magicians with pointy hats or turbans take shit out of the hat for applause. Except it's not just bunnies and doves, it's like, an entire calf, a 7 foot spear, the vizir's scepter (now how did that end up there?), etc.


17. Dragon / Musshusshu Taming - Put a guy and a big animal or monster in the same cage. The guy then attempts to tame the thing to make cool tricks.

181,"Lets build a list of things that can make a fight more dynamic and fun. For example things that helps creativity and gives opportunities to engage with the environment.

# 100 things that make combat more interesting

1. The fight takes place on a bridge over a river filled with crocodiles
2. The opposition flees but comes back with a dangerous weapon
3. A animal (for example a moose) comes rushing into the fight crashing into one of the players
4. The fight takes place on a giant ant hill
5. One of the monsters plays dead, but attacks when someone comes near
6. DM draws edges of battlefield, and invites players to draw in the rocky outcrops that both players an enemies will use for vantage and cover, without knowing what the nature of the pursuing enemies are.  [**Plavixo**](
7. there are smaller monsters in the walls (i used rats). I roll a d12 and as many holes as the PCs can plug are the number of enemies I subtract from the total coming to kick their asses. [**Chance\_Educator7705**](
8. (small combat) Darkness spell cast on a room with only enemies inside. Enemies roughly know the location of the PCs, and PCs roughly know the location of the enemies before the spell went up. [**Chance\_Educator7705**](
9. Battle happens in a large pit. There are levers (or some other trigger) in the walls that the enemies are trying to activate. Activating the levers starts to fill the pit with water, and the more levers flipped the more water this is. I ran this one and ended the combat by letting my players unplug gold from a large duct in the centre of the room so they all got washed away. [**Chance\_Educator7705**](
10. moving platforms. The ground moves every round and make players at random roll dex saves so they don't get brained by flying rock or metal grate. [**Chance\_Educator7705**](
11. When the enemies fail their attack rolls they hit their own allies, inciting failed tactics and enemy on enemy violence (for battles you want to be especially confusing. don't let it drag on) [**Chance\_Educator7705**](
12. battle with shapechangers who have the PC's faces (good for some horror rp) [**Chance\_Educator7705**](
13. combat with enemies actively sinking into quicksand. PCs just need to survive for x number of rounds. [**Chance\_Educator7705**](
14. Three-Dimensional Combat. If your player wants to vault a table and use the momentum to strike the enemy, go ahead and let him. Hell, let the attack do a bit of extra damage. [**prancingDM**](
15. Battle starts on a moving train, every so often an obstacle appears and the players have to either move out of the way or make a DEX save to avoid it. [**UmbramonOrSomething**](
16. The battle is against shadow versions of the player characters, the shadows share the exact character sheet as the players, always move directly after their player counterpart, and only attack their player counterpart. [**UmbramonOrSomething**](
17. smoot ice, where if players move more than 15 ft? They have to roll a dex save. On a fail they glide an extra 5-15 ft. It was fun to see somebody slide out of melee range, but also a low HP player used it to run away, and slide extra distance, getting him out of monster range. [**AnotherPerspective87**](
18. swamp, where certain areas of the fight are bogs (difficult terrain).
19. a small ravine with cliffs. And some ladders to go up-down. Lot of fun when a pair of goblins stage-dived on the players. 1 killing itself, one getting in melee range. [**AnotherPerspective87**](
20. a dense fog. Where every target >15 ft was light obscured, > 25 heavy obscure, > 35 invisible in the fog. That was pretty interesting with ice mephits, being able to hide in the icy snow as soon as they dash into the fog. And then summon more mephits when the players can't find them. [**AnotherPerspective87**](
21. A powerful monster or opponent shows up, that is hostile to both you and your opponent.  [**World\_of\_Ideas**](
22. Controls (buttons, levers, pressure plates, pull cords, turn cranks) that activate various traps or hazardous machinery in the area.  [**World\_of\_Ideas**](
23. Fighting in a field of geysers. Geysers occasional spray (scalding hot water, steam, lava) into the air. Anyone too close when they go off takes damage. Eruption can possibly be timed or perhaps they make a distinctive noise just before the eruption.  [**World\_of\_Ideas**](
24. Fighting in an underwater (structure, tunnel). Any missed shot or area of effect attack can potentially damage the walls. Any damage to the walls creates leaks. Too much damage will cause the entire area to rapidly flood.  [**World\_of\_Ideas**](
25. Fighting in zero gravity.  [**World\_of\_Ideas**](
26. Fighting near a hill that boulders are rolling down. Each round you can try to end your movement out of the path of a boulder or try to dodge it with a DEX roll.  [**World\_of\_Ideas**](
27. Fighting near a (rooted, stationary monster). You and your opponents are fighting near a monster that can't move. It can reach ""x"" distance to grab anyone who gets too close. EX: rooted tree monster / pit monster from Star Wars / giant squid or octopus that can't leave the water.  [**World\_of\_Ideas**](
28. Fighting on a balance platform. Movement alters the distribution of weight causing the platform to tilt towards the heavy side. [**World\_of\_Ideas**](
29. Fighting on a narrow ledge.  [**World\_of\_Ideas**](
30. Fighting on a slippery slope.  [**World\_of\_Ideas**](
31. Killing the minions somehow makes the boss more powerful.  [**World\_of\_Ideas**](
32. Opponents are (innocent victims, someone you care about, someone important) being mind controlled or possessed so you really don't want to kill them, but they are blocking your path to the one who is controlling them.  [**World\_of\_Ideas**](
33. There are innocent bystanders nearby. Any missed shot or area effect attack could injure or kill them. You opponent may also try to take one as a hostage or use them as a shield. [**World\_of\_Ideas**](
34. You don't have to kill your opponents you only have to delay them for ""x"" turns. Then (you teleport away / they teleport away / your reinforcements show up / your ritual is completed / their ritual fails / they transform back into something harmless / their intended victim escapes / etc) [**World\_of\_Ideas**](
35. Get away from race to zero HP. [**kelltain**](
36. The players must safeguard an area, either by occupying it themselves for long enough, or sealing a constant stream of enemies out.[**kelltain**](
37. The players must wound or kill a key target. A spellcaster is traditional.[**kelltain**](
38. The players must escape an area.[**kelltain**](
39. The players must kill enemies in a specific order.[**kelltain**](
40. The players must lure enemies to a specific location.[**kelltain**](
41. The players must collect an item and safeguard it for a certain duration. Carrying the item causes pain or inflicts debuffs.[**kelltain**](
42. The players must race the enemy to a fixed location.[**kelltain**](
43. The players must impress an audience.[**kelltain**](
44. The players must cause or prevent a rout. Certain enemies are holding together the opposing team's morale.[**kelltain**](
45. The players must rescue friendly combatants.[**kelltain**](
46. The players must take a specific enemy captive. [**kelltain**](
47. The players must plant an item at a fixed location. [**kelltain**](
48. The players must sow division between enemy forces.  [**kelltain**](
49. The players must force their way into a sensitive enemy position, capture a high-ranking intelligence officer, plant an explosive to stop their pursuers, and escape.  [**kelltain**](
50. The players must save the inn's staff, barricade off the building's perimeter, and find and destroy the necromantic lure that's drawing the undead there.  [**kelltain**](
51. The players must defile a shrine (control area, seize item) to a dark god by realigning it with their patron in order to disrupt a ritual before the ghost-mage can finish their invocation. [**kelltain**](
52. The enemy has magical protection so that you have to remove exactly the right number of HP. If players do more damage than the HP they have left, it heals them for that amount. [**snakeskinrug**](
53. Make trip attacks attractive. Battle takes place on a surface that turns into a slope. The ground is difficult terrain. Characters that go prone or start their turn that prone move 15’ downslope. Str or Dex save to prevent falling off the edge.[**onepostandbye**](
54. Make disarm attacks attractive. Battle takes place on a grate-like elevated platform. Dropped weapons and items have a chance to fall through the grate, based on size.[**onepostandbye**](
55. Start the battle with a powerful ally in a dying state. Getting that ally up and fighting is potentially more effective than fighting directly. [**onepostandbye**](
56. Make everyone fight with one hand. Battle takes place in an area filled with hanging chains. Two hands needed to move, one hand is the most available for combat. [**onepostandbye**](
57. Pull in monster hunter/blood born weapons: hence get weapons that allow for the use of bonus actions or reactions  [**Emotional\_Guillotine**](
58. The map is shrinking as water (or worse) floods the arena. [**Ok\_Blackberry\_1223**](
59. The fight is in a massive library. Shelves give cover but are highly flammable. Maybe the pcs need to protect the Knowledge within. [**Ok\_Blackberry\_1223**](
60. Both sides must be quite for fear of waking something far more dangerous than either of them. [**Ok\_Blackberry\_1223**](
61. The map has many tiny tunnels which pcs must squeeze through, but the small enemies have an easy time and can harass as they please.[**Ok\_Blackberry\_1223**](
62. The boss has items scattered throughout which buff or heal him and must be destroyed first. [**Ok\_Blackberry\_1223**](
63. The enemy IS the battlefield. The players must defeat some creature they are on top of, finding a weak spot while avoiding being hurt or knocked off. [**Ok\_Blackberry\_1223**](
64. Exploding barrels! Who doesn’t love those.  [**Ok\_Blackberry\_1223**](
182,"I have a city-watch captain NPC who mentioned he lost all other senses of humor besides puns once he became a dad.

183,"It doesn't have to be specifically in the Firefly verse. Ideally, anyone running a Star Wars FFG Edge of The Empire, GURPS Space, Traveler or, of course Firefly Cortex RPG should be able to use this. Now, how about I give a couple of examples to get the creative juices flowing, shall we! :D

1. The crew has taken on a dangerous job with a very wealthy and very psychotic Syndicate Viceroy, the job you ask? Head to a restricted planet and steal a cache of supplies from an underground research bunker, the only problem is the whole rock is filled with high tech security systems, death droids and of course, feds, lots and lots of feds. After the crew gets the cache and heads to the meeting point to finish the deal, they find out what they're really transporting is a bioweapon that the Viceroy intends to sell for the highest bidder. Do they give the weapon to him, and make enough money to be set for life, or do they destroy it ensuring the Viceroy will try to hunt them down and make an example out of them.
2. While dropping off some *illicit* cargo on a small backwater moon out in the middle of nowhere. The captain is arrested by the town's sheriff and must undergo a trail. Turns out, he was in town several cycles back and killed a man in a bar fight, only problem is the captain doesn't remember the bar fight, or ever being anywhere on this planet. The rest of the crew need to win the trial to save his life.
3. The crew decide to take on passengers to earn a little extra credits on the way to their next job. Not even half way out of the system, a ruthless bounty hunter shoots their ship outta the sky. The planet they crash on is a hostile world with nights below negative 50. Now, the crew has to juggle keeping their passengers alive, finding a away off this frozen rock, and evading a merciless bounty hunter who doesn't care about collateral damage.
4. While the captain is out having a drink at the local spaceport, a stranger slips a piece of paper in his clothes before being killed by local law enforcement. After the bar closes early and the captain returns to the ship, only to he find the paper and sees dollar signs. The man at the bar was looking for ancient colony ship that never made it all of the way to this system, but if found could make a someone rich beyond belief from the 10% finders fee alone, a lot more so from selling the supplies on the black market. Now the crew has to race to find clues before anyone else, and hope whoever killed that man doesn't go after them.
5. While on a desert world getting their ship repaired, the whole craft gets dismantle by scavengers. After tracking the thieves and demanding their parts back, the local Syndicate wants them to do a job to earn them back. They want the crew to break out a prisoner from a penal bare ran by the feds. Only this job ain't what it seems.
6. Two criminal organizations are winding down their turf war, freeing them up to each consolidate and expand their own territory. This is bad for a third, smaller organization, which was benefiting from their preoccupation with one another. They want you to reignite the turf war between the biggies. By
7. A group suspected of involvement with organized crime hire you to transport much needed medicines to a mining town on a remote planetoid, where there’s an epidemic. One of your passengers is a doctor and examines the medicines and informs you that it’s counterfeit drugs that not only don’t work as advertised but are also a very addictive drug, unlike the real medicine. The doctor knows how and where you can get the real medicines for cheap or steal them, but if you do you will get in trouble with the syndicate. By"
184,"I made a list of random enemy encounters and observations coming to mind as you travel through the lands of Skyrim in an elder scrolls dnd or any rpg. I play solo random generated adventures but you can apply this list to multiplayer. The lower rolls normally are worse than higher rolls so it starts with lots of enemies and eases into positive things like finding random treasures and resources. Scattered throughout is also unimportant things like seeing a bird (however you could try shooting it down if you want it’s resources) and getting dust in the eye (just random flavour for the party to laugh at)… i also have some creepy things. The idea with this list is I travel through skyrim, the map divided into hex or boxes, and each box i go through i roll d100, so from whiterun to solitude is about 5 boxes, so i roll 5 times to get there. If i want to recklessly travel i can move 2 boxes for only 1 roll however if you encounter an enemy they may have a surprise round or advantage on initiative. if you travel horse/carriage you can still roll and may be able to outrun enemies.

i don’t have things like draugr because they are living in delves, or dragonpriests because they are at certain locations. I don’t have dragons because my game is set before the events of skyrim.

Certain enemies are not necessarily lore accurate to TES but incorporate D&D elements.

189,"Short descriptions of what players see in the streets and alleys of a bustling metropolis.

**EDIT:** The city I have in mind is a high fantasy classic medieval city, so preferably leave out factories and such. But since anyone can use these, I won't exclude those vignettes.

1. Quiet, old part of town: ""You see tall medieval houses with overhanging second stories and walls carpeted in ivy, flower boxes spilling over with greens and yellows and pinks. You can smell fresh earth and sweet flowers, many of them are starting to wilt in the autumn air, but then you spot an elf woman leaning out to water her tulips. Pixies flit up to her and wave some golden dust over them, and they immediately brighten up again. The elf hands them a cube of sugar and they flit off to other flower boxes.""
2. Rundown slum: ""These streets seems clad in a shroud of mist and smoke, the air is wet and chilly and smells of filth. Figures lurk in the alleyways, watching you. Some kids are playing in the mud at the center of it all, laughing despite their circumstances. Laundry hangs overhead, the houses are saggy and cramped, but their windows are spotlessly clean. You see a lanky warforged with burnished coppery plates cleaning them slowly and thoroughly.""
3. Tavern street: ""You climb a steep street where hanging over you are dozens of painted signs in all kinds of fonts, colors, and imagery, pointing you to taverns and inns. You can smell the beer and wine breath of tipsy passerby, but also savory stews and fresh bread coming from the open doors, which radiate warm light and the sounds of people blowing off steam. One open-air tavern has two off-duty watchmen gambling with dice and drinking mead. You see one rolls, slaps his forehead, and hands over some gold to the smug one.""
4. Arcane Alley: ""A cramped chaotic jumble of shopfronts, bookstores, and lean-tos, the smell of all kinds of magic fills the air, alongside a cacophony of crackles, fizzes, and small low booms. Many of the people here are clad in wizard robes and big hats. A gnome alchemist selling potions from a ramshackle cart, a dwarf wizard looking at a display of staffs, and a human adventurer covered in multicolored scars sells mystery meat-kebabs out of a bag of holding.""
5. Sword Street: ""The clang of metal and the smell of smoke fills the air. The sunlight gleams off dozens upon dozens of swords on racks and cloths, displayed for potential buyers. You see a scarred elven man with a rapier arguing with a dwarf. In another corner, there's a orange tiefling selling daggers out of his bag, but he seems shady and not a lot seem to buy from him.""
6. The Lime Kiln: Towering blocks of brick with even taller chimneys belching smoke endlessly hulk here, next to large piles of coal or wood. Only the poorest of the poor live near here as the toxic vapors and ash are caustic and poisonous and a toxic gas (Carbon Monoxide) fills low lying areas. Drunkards and fools occasionally sleep nearby in the winter because the furnaces are warm and are lit most days in the kingdom's endless need for Lime (Crushed and Heat Treated Limestone) and Coke (For Iron and Steel). One of the properties of those affected by the gas is falling unconscious, or not being able to be awakened if sleeping, then death by suffocation happens quickly. 
7. Slaughterhouse Row: The kingdom needs meat, and these large slaughter yards are filled with animals awaiting slaughter and then butchery. The pay is decent, but safety standards are minimal, and every year at least a handful of workers die and twice as many are maimed in the process. The animals' foul odors combine with the vile processes of industry nearby (Horn, Hide, Fat Rendering, and the Boneyard) in large sprawling warehouses, to drive down rents downwind. Little known, but the area may also be used by the kingdom's military to produce Nitre (a component in gunpowder, and a potent fertilizer) from the collected waste.
8. The Waulking Fuller: A clockwork industrial facility that processes, weaves, and dies Wool fabric. A little known fact that naturally occurring lanolins must be stripped from wool using boiling ammonia or urea (from urine), woven into fabric, the fiber strands stretched, and then pounded with great mallets while wet, then tenterhooked to dry. A maze of woolen fabrics stretched like ropes fill the space, the air reeks of piss, and the complex wooden and brass power looms, trip hammers, steamy boiling cauldrons, etc., make the place horrendously noisy and dangerous to work in.
9. The Intertidal: Beneath the expansive wooden docks are a motley collection of piles, wooden boards, tidal mud, and several secret gathering places, nooks, and crannies, where the undesirables and criminal elements gather, spies hold dead drops, and bodies are occasionally carelessly disposed of. Individuals willing to foul themselves may locate several sewer openings (no larger than 5 feet in any dimension) that lead into the city's vast underground sewer network.
10. The Cloaca Maxima: Holborne Street, above, follows the path of an ancient river, now turned completely subterranean and used as the city's largest sewer, built by the Great Ancient Emperors of Old. A significant number of monuments and statues are along the Street's length, including the Dragon at Temple Bahamut, a new brass statue commemorating the great Admiral Peeperus' victories, and the Kingdom's large, energetic, and powerful printing press industry. It is perhaps fitting that the kingdom's largest sewer runs beneath the presses printing the kingdom's broadsheets...
11. The Riverside Docks: ""Impressive masts and swiveling cranes loom over the jumble of creaking piers, shouting longshoremen and anxious merchants directing their precious cargo. This place never sleeps, at night it just dims down the shouting a bit. Off the piers there are large warehouses of the trading families, taverns for the sailors, and back alleys for a quick handover or getting stabbed in the guts, sometimes both.
12. The City Icehouse: this is a giant brick underground cavern, where ice is imported during the winter months and stored over the year. Close to it, you will find butcher shops and icemen, both loudly advertising their wares in front of their thick-walled establishments.
13. The River: winding through the metropolis in slow, smelly glory is the River. From the distant mountains it brings water and goods, and in return the city blesses it with its waste. Sewage, trash and - downstream - the effluents of the tanner's guild make the river a sludgy mess. It is crossed by three stone-arch bridges, each a daily chokepoint for anyone wishing to cross.
14.  Misty Market - From the end of the alley, it looks charming. Paper lanterns, spires of spices and friendly faces greet unwary travelers and seasoned merchants alike. The deeper one travels into the interlinked, cloth covered booths, the stranger the wares and the sharper the tongues. Stray too deeply into the market and you risk everything. As they say, ""Beware the Misty Market, 'afore you be wares!"" 
15.  Forgotten street: the two most developed streets from a circle, and in that circle lies a forgotten alley. Run down and desolate one story buildings line this alley, a few cats can be seen on a thatch roof, wild dogs are fighting over what looks like an arm near the center. The alley looks almost endless, puddles of excrement and dirty water are everywhere on this old stone road that's sinking into the mud. Bugs of all kinds buzz around the collapsing houses, fading graffiti of images are on the walls, decades old. The sound of the city remains in the players ears, yet here there is none to make it "
190,"I have a college of eloquence bard where he gives inspiration in the form of phrases or things people who are high would say/ask. Can you help me come up with 100 things he would say so I can throw these out to the party to get a chuckle and a groan each time. I know I could google examples on the internet but I wanted the phrases/questions to be relevant to the world of d&d and that is what I am struggling with, hopefully your wonderful minds can help me!

I would always be starting off any inspiration he would provide by taking a puff of the pipe and say the phrase. I've given 5 examples to start with as requested by the rules:

&#x200B;

1. If two wizards cast detect thoughts on each other, whose mind are they reading?
2. If a wizard casts clone and kills it. Is that suicide or murder?
3. If 2 Vegan druids are arguing, is it still considered beef?
4. If you drop soap on the floor. Is the floor clean or the soap dirty?
5. If money is the root of all Evil, why do they ask for it in all the temples? 
6. What if rocks are actually soft but tense up when we touch them? [/Wikilast]
7. If life was a bird, you’d be the feathers. [/MacroAlgalFagasaurus]
8. ""hey do we know any druids that know Plant Growth..? I just got an awesome idea"" *stares at herb in your pipe* [/ironman_BTW]
9. If I use vicious mockery and describe someone who's ugly, is it mockery or honesty? [/Aquashinez]
10. You ever wonder if there are tall dwarves that blend in with humans? [/Ken_NT]
11. If a male minotaur got a female centaur pregnant, would the baby be a human, or a horse? [/disturbednadir]
12. This line is taking forever (following a stealth party) [/Torvaak]
13. ""If two mermaids have a baby, is there a one in four chance the baby is a fish?"" [/Winnipeginstinct]
14. What if rocks actually taste like strawberries, but a wizard has been casting prestidigitation to make them all taste like rock? [/Snaptune]
15. Bro a deaf kenku can’t speak at all right? [/Technicalanimator874]
16. Dragons: What are they dragging? Why aren't they called Flyons? [/Tealswinglinestapler]
17. When you kill someone with fireball, there is probably a very brief moment where the meat is perfectly cooked. [/Dedli]
18. I wonder how myconids taste on pizza. [/Racoonsinatrenchcoat]
19. To a sorcerer/wizard/artificer:  I need you to cast enlarge on a very specific part of my body... [/Racoonsinatrenchcoat]
20. Why would you ever cast cloudkill?  What did a cloud ever do to you? [/Racoonsinatrenchcoat]
21. What if there is someplace like home? [/Racoonsinatrenchcoat]
22. Brooo, What if we’re mimics who are just like, too good at mimicking? [/DaniwhohatesCVS]
23. Okay so stick with me here, have you ever seen a baby goblin? No? What if all the goblins we're killing are actually the babies and they grow up to be like... Trolls or something? [/GameDesignerMan]"

193,"This is pulled from the new radiant citadel book for 5e, but can we build a table of merchants/vendors that would be at an informal, interdimensional farmers market? Also it happens at night idk. I'm thinking

1. Olafs Optics- all varieties of glass eyes. Some human, some Dwarven, some owlbears. Some appear to be moving on the shelves??

2. Avian tendencies- a cluttered mess of birdcages, some of which contain birds. Others contain large moths, pseudodragons, flying puff frogs, and even winged and mobile mushrooms. 

3. Impractical Armour- everyone knows bikini mail. What about a steel eyepatch?  A mithril thimble? Or codplate? Come see how effective it can be!

4. Ugh's Esoteric Ingredients- Owned by an ancient and mysterious half orc named Ugh, this stall is here to make every feast a heroes feast! Chock full of exotic and potent herbs and spices, this is the place to go.if you need to chef to impress!"
194,"I love D&D items with random harmless effects. So let's make a list of random effects that anyone can pull in a pinch to spice up an artifact or object. The effect has to be completely harmless, and self contained to the object. What do I mean by self contained? Well, it can't produce something tangible or affect a creature beyond a surface level sensory feeling.

An example of a **NOT** self contained effect would be: *While this object is in your person, you'll always have the same dream.* It's not self contained in the sense that the effect isn't in the object itself, but it extends to a creature. Another example would be *This object constantly drips water* as you could feasibly hang it above a bowl and you'd get infinite water. It's producing something that can be taken out of the object itself.

I hope I was clear enough, now let's go with the list itself:

1.  This object can't be tied up. If you were to try and tie a string, rope, wire or such around it, it'll mysteriously slip out before you can fasten it.

2. This object feels wet to the touch, though it doesn't actually make anything it touches wet.

3. This object is strangely sweet. Anyone that licks it will get a strong, almost sickly taste of honey.

4. This object is completely covered in a thin layer of moss. If the moss is removed it instantly withers and turns to dust. After a few minutes, the moss will grow back on the object.

5. This object gives off a new smell never before smelled. It's not particularly good or bad, but you cannot point to any similar smells. Trying to understand this smell is like trying to imagine a new color.

6. This object has the sponge-like quality of absorbing liquid. It can only absorb as much liquid as a sponge of that size would, and it's weight increases accordingly. \[/sonofabutch\]

7. This object, even when dry, leaves a ""ring"" on surfaces, like a wet glass on a wooden table. \[/sonofabutch\]

8. This object feels lighter than it should be based on it's composition. When weighed, it's weight is normal. \[/rbergs215\]

196,"Modern setting. Players come across a Ouija board abandoned on the side of the road. The pick it up and find something odd about it. What is it?


1. Pristine packaging, but the Ouija board itself inside is burned.


2. Paw prints on the planchette


3. It's damaged, seemingly by human fists and then half human half goat fists, and then goat prints that lead away


4. Weathered like it's been there for a long time but otherwise fine, but then right after picking it up, eyes in the night keep watching from a distance

198,"Magical Pranks, Tricks and Practical jokes

 Mean-spirited is fine, creative and silly is better, painful is okay, but not necessarily dangerous.  My original idea encompasses an urban fantasy / Shadowrun setting, but any magical will work.

1.  Between midnight and dawn, the path from bedside to toilet suddenly turns into a five minute labyrinth, complete with traps, monster sounds (and maybe monsters), and confusing illusions.  Your post-drinking 2 o'clock pee run is not gonna go well for you.

2.  For 24 hours, everything you encounter back-sasses you:  your car is a nagging backseat driver, your sofa whines and moans about your weight and B.O., your food begs for its life and screams when you bite it, your mirror goes Mean Girl and comments on your body and clothing choices.

3.  You are beset by a mercenary imp who follows you around, insulting you, trying to trip you up or inflict minor injuries, and otherwise trying to be as big a pest as possible.  You can't touch him, and nobody but you can see or hear him.

4.  Every door you touch zaps you, every cup or utensil you touch burns you (even if it wouldn't normally be hot, like a spoon with ice cream).

5.  For 24 hours, everybody thinks you smell bad.  It's not even the same smell:  one smells dog poo on your shoe, another thinks you haven't showered in a week, another thinks you spilled rancid fish on your clothes at lunch.  You smell nothing.

6. ( ) A piece of your equipment is animated.  It tries to play keep away.

7.  ( )  When you put on your boots the spell reverse gravity is cast on them.


8.   ( )  A bucket of ""water"" is dropped on you. The liquid magically makes everything you touch stick to you.


9.   ( ) When you drink this potion every step you make will do a farting noise. Every tenth will be accompanied by the smell...


10.   ( )  The cake is a lie... I mean an illusion. It's just mud. 


11.   ( )  It's a bird? It's a plane? No! It's a magic missile! Too bad your favorite mug is dead...

12.  ( )  A hat casts disguise self as you in your underwear or in some silly costume.

13.  ( ) Trip hazards spawn in random locations around you, it's just a manner of time before you or others are tripped

14.  ( ) Everything you eat or drink for 24 hours has an extremely bitter, sour, rotten, or spicy taste to it.

15.  () When you bathe or have any water touch your head, shampoo constantly regenerates on your head for at least 15 minutes.

16.  ( ) A taped note spawns on your back that is an alternative from the original ""Kick me"", perhaps something like: ""Polymorph me"", ""The Demon Prince Rules"", or ""The night watch sucks""

17.  ( )  The spell caster chooses one of the ""seven deadly sins"" of their choice. For the next 24 hours whenever the victim subtlety contemplates or acts out the specific sin. A celestial being appears to scold them and figuratively slap their hand. This can happen in their dreams as well."

201,"Compiling a list of 100 mass effect trinkets (milky way), lets do this!

D100 Mass Effect Trinkets

1. **Drell Prayer coin** \-  different coins have different meanings. Some are meant to help focus the mind, others meant to help relieve restlessness.
2. **Vorcha bone charm** \- Created by vorcha from real vorcha bone, these trinkets are often meant to honor loved ones passed from this world.
3. **Turian Guessing Beans** \- A bag of small white dextro candy. When placed in the mouth, the candies disolve revealing a color. The person eating the bean must guess the color of the bean without viewing it. Different colors correspond to different flavors. The beans are designed to teach children to memorize tastes. When military training begins a different version is used. This time the flavors are that of different hazardous chemicals, poisons, and toxic plants recruits may come across
4. **Asari Spa Brochure** \- A small, folded brochure advertising a luxurious Asari-operated wellness and spa center. Among other things, it offers Biotics-enhanced massages.
5. **A dusty pair of safety goggles** \- made for the Salarian head shape
6. **Martian Hourglass** – An hourglass filled with red sand (not the drug) from mars, a common souvenir from those who have visited the red planet, or called it home.
7. **Holographic Arrow** – a small holo-puck with an adhesive side, it has an internal batter, and produces an arrow when activated. These arrows have many utility purposes.
8. **Elcor Emotion Dictionary** \- Each page  has an emotive word and the pheromone associated, so that Elcor can  learn their unique speech pattern for the benefit of other species
9. **Volus  Coin Set** \- Basic coins of various currency for Volus young to learn  exchange rates. Often a gift for the Volus’ 5th birthday
10. **Commemorative  Resin Talisman** \- When humans first set up new colonies across the  galaxy, they often take with them a single blade of earthly grass,  preserved in resin, as a reminder of home
11. **Quarian Compass -** Sometimes given as a gift when the Quarian sets off on their Pilgrimage. A simple trinket, with little practical purpose.
12. **Varren fang necklace** \- bound in leather and strung on a thick band, it shows marks of a Krogan clan.
13. **Pyjak doll** \- a small plushie of a pyjak, likely bought from a gift shop, but it's been stitched back together numerous times.
14. **Ship keychain** \- a tiny model of a ship, maybe it is a ship of some importance to you (such as a quarian liveship you lived on, or an alliance ship you were stationed on.)
15. **Batarian  Slave chip** \- batarian slavers implant control devices into the skulls  of their captives. Due to a lack of anesthetic, the installation process  is incredibly painful. The removal was even worse.
16. **Raloi  feather** \- the avian Raloi were only briefly apart of Galactic society before withdrawing to their homeworld.
17. **Quarian  Love Locket** \- A rare quarian object, who knows where it came from. It's one of the few pictures of a Quarian without a  helmet you've seen.  Perhaps if you are Asari, your mothers' first husband was a Quarian, and he passed away many centuries ago? Or perhaps you bought it at a strange interstellar Bazaar? Who can say.
18. **Batarian Quad-focals** \- corrective eyesight devices for everyone's ""favourite"" four-eyed aliens.
19. **Tentacle Disinfectant** \- designed to clean hanar tentacles between walking / floating and eating. Also popular with Asari for their fringes, though few would ever admit to using it.
20. **Volus menthol -** because they spend so much time in their suits, volus have  created a wide variety of menthols and other such items that can be  easily ingested without taking the suit off.
21. **Quarian medical handbook** \- A small handbook which would nestle nicely in a Quarian's suit pocket.

Edit: thank you all for the ideas! I will update the post tomorrow and add a few more myself

Edit2: Once again, thank you all for your contributions! I have updated the list with all of the suggested entries and given credit. I will be going through and look for duplicates and adjust them. I will also try to fill out the rest of the list, until then please leave any further suggestions!"
205,"1. A large manual detailing how to properly harvest and store various ingredients harvested all manner of monsters.
2. An immense tome containing all known information on the Elixir of Life, a legendary potion said to grant immortality to whoever drinks it.
3. A transparent vat that contains the alchemically preserved remains of an unidentifiable humanoid.
4. A large cauldron that contains bubbling, multi-colored liquid.
5. A tome detailing the creation of several potent narcotics and other illegal substances."
206,"It's a big social event day, perhaps a feast day. All the fine lords and ladies, the knights and the damsels are all organized in the main hall, talking about politics, wooing one another, dancing...

...But you're not there, are you. Not yet. You're just 18 or 19, they still treat you like a kid even though you think you're an adult. So you have to make your own fun with the other squires, handmaidens, and other kinds of youthful persons of the court.

Think of it like ""What would Romeo and his buddies be doing"". And please avoid entries that *rely* on someone being an elf or a dwarf or something, because they're harder to port to human-only games (or games where elfs and dwarfs are rarer).

1. They've smuggled a bottle of wine, drained it in its entirety, and are now playing spin the bottle, of course.

2. Two squires of opposing houses got into an argument about how the other's house is entirely made of scoundrels or how their mothers smell like elderberries, now they're saying they'll duel and are looking for seconds.

3. They boys are on the courtyard playing a game of trying to throw spears as far as they can to impress the ladies. The ladies are either watching intently and giggling, or entirely nonplussed about it.

4. They've decided to bounce from the party and went to somewhere in the nearby woods or beach, dug a hole, made fire inside it, and are now chilling around it and getting naughty.

5. They've climbed up to the highest point in the castle (or a nearby hill in the case of a mansion) and are now throwing stuff aimlessly from up there and chilling.

6. They've went to the nearby lake to swim, it's a hot night. If it's a cold night, then it's to dare one another to swim laps and come back.

7. They've resorted to bullying and humiliating the quiet kid until they break down crying and run away.

8. Two of the ladies really hate one another's guts and are now plotting on the best way to humiliate one another / steal the other's man.

9. They're trying on makeup on everyone and having a blast with it too - the adults on the other room would get *very angry* if they found out.

10. They've gone to the nearby woods and are now frollicking among the trees and, as always, doing naughty business. A few stragglers are just standing awkwardly on the edge of the woods, and a couple kids in particular seem to be having a very bad time.  Looks like their date is running around with another.

11. They're plotting about getting back at the adults by unleashing a bunch of frogs, or hogs, right in the middle of the ballroom. The hard part is making it look like an accident.

12. They've found an abandoned building, set it on fire, and are now watching it burn.

13. Someone found mushrooms around and now they're all tripping balls.

14. They're playing a gambling game [/RealRamessesII]

15. They're playing a truth-telling game (truth or dare, never have I ever, etc.) [/RealRamessesII]

16. One squire swiped a magic wand from his master and they're all trying to figure out how to use it. [/RealRamessesII]

17. They're daring each other to try and sneak into the main hall without getting caught. [/RealRamessesII]

18. They're having an impromptu song/poetry contest that's rapidly devolving into toilet humor. [/RealRamessesII]

19. The squires have meet the local warlock (or warlocks) who are now regaling the impressionable youths with the advantages of a patron. Could be for bad, good, weird, or the nonsensical but the youths are tempted to take the short cuts of a quick deal. [/PensandSwords3]

20. They were having an impromptu board breaking contest instigated by a local who provided a supply of what were, in retrospect, expensive boards of wood. They are currently hiding from the royal carpenter's wrath while desperately looking for tweezers suitable for removing splinters. [/Bellwright]

21. The 8 of them are playing a game of cards for what they think are imaginary stakes like ""the hand in marriage of my seventh son"" or ""the emerald eyes of Chun."" 8? Shouldn't there be 7? [/Bellwright]

22. One of them misunderstood an assignment from their master and is drunkenly trying to stop a cardinal (bird) from attending the feast. The others are helping or hindering as inclination allows. [/Bellwright]

23. They are replacing the incense used in the upcoming ceremony with a more 'relaxing' blend. [/Bellwright]

24. Two of the squires have found a stray cat and tied a tin can to it's tail. Other squires are either assisting or trying to hinder this (Yes this is cruel, yes it's a thing that used to happen, if you don't think your players will roleplay this enjoyably don't include it, have lines and veils in your game) [/bigvyner]

25. They have acquired a ball and are playing a game of ""indoor ball war"". There are elaborate rules- the ball may only be touched with the feet, there are 7 sets of goals, and in the case of a tiebreaker the winner is the team that can run to the top of the rickety old abandoned tower staircase and back the fastest. [/bigvyner]

26. Someone has found a painting of a gorgon's head, and they are playing a variation of ""dont get seen moving"" where whoever holds the painting turns it towards the wall but then spins around and presents it to the ""movers"" [/bigvyner]

27. ""Somebody"" has decided they are going to ride the King's warhorse, and it has been saddled and let out of the stables. (What happens next will shock you!) [/bigvyner]

28. One of the hunting hounds has had puppies. They are cute. They have been smuggled inside and are being fed treats. The proud parental hounds look on. [/bigvyner]

29. The Romantic Adventures of Cyrano is currently the most popular book among the squires, and they are acting out scenes from it and arguing about who gets to play what part. [/bigvyner]

30. The kitchen was short staffed and all of the squires have been pressed into service peeling potatoes, plucking chickens, washing dishes, and various other kitchen chores. [/bigvyner]

31. Somebody discovered a broken vase, and the oldest of the kids has been forced into playing ""The World's Greatest Detective"" as they ask questions to un-mask the committer of this evil crime, to the great delight of all the younger ones. [/bigvyner]

32. The local Jester is teaching them juggling, and is also teaching them songs which THEY think are just fun to sing, but which will TOTALLY embarrass the lord of the castle if he hears them sing it due to a few hidden meanings and references. Most of the adults will get the joke. He licked the cheese, he licked the butter, and words of love he did utter... [/bigvyner]

33. Snail / mouse / turtle / beetle races [/pennyraingoose]

34. They've broken out a Ouija Board for shots and giggles and have invited a Demon/Devil to the party by accident. [/InuGhost]

35. One of them has found a Deck of Cards and they're unwittingly playing around with a Deck of a many Things. [/InuGhost]

36. They're being hunted by Doppelgangers or Raksasha. Whom are planning to replace the youngings and take over the kingdom. [/InuGhost]

37. They're bored and making up fun/exciting stories of what really they were up to as opposed to just sitting around all night talking. [/InuGhost]

38. One squire is telling the others he saw a goblin hideout the other day and bets no one else would be brave enough to sneak in and see what kind of loot they have [/baryonyxbat]

39. Someone caught a tiny creature/monster and snuck it in, they try to keep it hidden but it escapes and hijinks ensues [/baryonyxbat]

40. The squires and handmaidens are discussing over which of their bosses is the strongest in a very heated argument. Until they decide to settle the score with dices and a paper with their boss's main details and a third neutral person. (Yes. They were going to play dungeons & dragon's) [/Hereva]

41. The Shiest of the nobles is close to being in his marrying age but has absolutely no idea of how to interact with women, the participants as a whole became quite intrigued with the idea of helping a very ""inexperienced"" person opening up to that stuff. He ends up falling in love with the most responsible of the handmaidens in there. [/Hereva]

42. A handmaiden is playing the piano for a handful of her friends. The soothing, elegant music gradually lulls the listeners to sleep, after which the pianist slams her hands on the keys to awaken the listeners. [/MildlyUpsetGerbil]

43. A squire that has recently been betrothed is explaining to several single squires how to win the heart of a fair maiden with such excellent advice as, ""You may fascinate a woman by giving her a piece of cheese,"" and ""Get a hair and pin off her unperceived, twist the hair around the pin, and then throw them backwards into a river."" [/MildlyUpsetGerbil]

44. Someone's Executive Officer broke out the holystones and instructed the staff to clear the back floor to settle a bet (before going back to check on the Captain at the party)... a sort of ""funishment"" to show which midshipman is the best -- an Officer and Gentleman must know every task on the ship, and be able to outcompete any mere crewman! Scrub the floor the fastest and ""clear the deck for battle""! A few of the landlubber squires are game to compete too, and the house-staff are thrilled to get out of cleaning the floor. An Admiral has gotten bored from the party and is loudly, and drunkenly ""supervising"", threatening summary ""execution"" to the slowest... [/MaxSizeIs]

45. One of the squire's finest (and only) coat has ripped, and is trying to discreetly stitch it back together (poorly) with a bit of thread nicked form the chatelaine's sewing table. One of the staff is mocking them. [/MaxSizeIs]

46. A group of squires have snuck into the off-limits section of the House, and are investigating the servants' things. One exclaims finding something slightly valuable and ""above the servant's station"". [/MaxSizeIs]

47. They have formed a secret society dedicated to haruspexy and are all keeping an eye out for when as many of them as possible can sneak off to the barn in order to disembowel a calf. [/felagund]

48. They're straight up having an x project style party, half the youth are in rooms with locked doors, doing gods know what, and the rest are blackout drunk with several broken stained glass windows and someone's carriage? No horses and the stairs aren't wide enough but it's there anyway. [/_solounwnmas]

49. The wizard's apprentice brought an ancient spellbook as homework, and several squires stole the book and are tossing it between them, while the rest are enjoying the show or helping the apprentice recover the tome. [/_solounwnmas]

50. They're sleeping, just sleeping, in the floor cuddled with their peers. [/_solounwnmas]

51. Someone brought a lyre out and is singing melodies in a circle while the rest talk quietly amongst themselves. [/_solounwnmas]

52. They’re teaching each other rude words in other languages. (“Shit” in elven, dwarvish, orc, undercommon, …) [/d20an]"
207,"Context: This is for a one shot idea I've got in mind. The party starts off in a tavern, but as soon as they exit, instead of seeing the outside, they see the inside of another tavern, completely different than the last. Any door the player's open leads to a random tavern. The player's have to figure out how to escape this trap. (Haven't quite gotten that far yet, but it involves Mind Flayers)
Not needed, but I usually go by the rule of three (interesting things)
1. A completely basic tavern, with hunting head trophies on the wall. The owner gets angry if you tell a hunting story more impressive than his. One of the trophies is a human ear. 
2. A bright, vibrant tavern with bar maids that dance in flowing red dresses. Don't even think of touching them. A band plays every night to accompany the dances.
3. A high end, black and white bar with only male workers. You fill in the rest.
4. An underwater themed tavern, with arched walls and ceiling made of thick glass. Almost everything is made of glass. All kinds of sea creatures can be seen around or above. They look hungry.
5. A large, old bar with very few tables and a roaring fireplace. There only seems to be one worker, an older gentleman working the bar. He seems to be very knowledgeable on history, and talks as though he witnessed what he says himself.
6. A dirty, crowded tavern with a large fighting ring. The place smells like B.O. and cheap ale. They're just about to announce who wants to volunteer to beat the champion."
208,"In Star Wars, there is a planet called Iego, that has 1000 (exactly) moons... This isnt EXACTLY the right subreddit for this, but I am making a d1000 list of all the moons on Iego, yes its fanonical. But it will be very useful to star wars RPG players out there.

And who knows, maybe we can convert it to a list of more generic worlds and call it ""d1000 enigmatic worlds"" for all manner of scifi RPG's.

Also how the iego system works, is that it is essentially a planetary system with no sun, that resides in a warm nebulae that provides all the light and heat all the worlds need.

15. Mobororobororro - Natural systems on this shallow ocean world, have created an ocean of self sustaining alcoholic drink, it is semi-sweet and extremely deadly to most species if not treated right, a secret the diathim protect zealously.
16. Kooorshok - this moon is actually an unusally large wroshyr tree, floating dead in space
17. Grassland - A curious world of grassy plains, long ago this world was dead and lifeless. But then a sith cruiser slammed into the world, causing a cascading apocalyptic effect on the atmosphere, and from its hull beautiful plants began to grow, from canned fruit, and vegetable, and preserved food, spore in the ducts and vents... a world terraformed accidently through cataclysm, of sheer simplistic beauty, where every blade of grass resonates with a subtle darkness

42. Hendox sub: A cluster of loosely connected debris somehow still considered a moon"
209,"Nice town you've got there. But someone has to rule it.   
Whether it's a mayor, a magistrate or a town elder. Whether they've got power like an absolutist king  in their town or are mostly there to cut ribbons. Somehow, it has to be determined *who* *gets to rule*.

50. Election - Everyone can vote once in their lifetime. That vote then counts every election until the voter dies. 
51. Election - Everyone can vote once in their lifetime. The vote can change their vote when their candidate dies 
52. Other - Candidates are tied up and thrown into the water. If they float, they become the new leader. 
53. Other - Candidates are tied up and thrown into the water. If they float, they must be a witch and thus unsuitable. If they don't... well, that's awkward. 
54. Slide Rule: What better way to choose a ruler than to use a ruler? All you need is someone to put down an objective scale of rulerness to see how well they will likely do. [ ]
55. Representative Appointment: A bunch of cats decide which of them will be mayor, by sitting on the mayoral heating pad. [ ]
56. Other: Anyone can be a ruler. As they prove their competence, they gain a little more ruling power, until they have the most responsibilities. There are no less than three at any given time.[ ]
57. None: There is no ruler. Any implication they have one must be a delusion most severe. [ ]

60. Other: Every four years, a heavily haunted crypt/house/barrow mound opens up on the Autumnal Solstice for one night only.  Any number of candidates can enter, but only one survivor is allowed out in the morning and is subsequently appointed the new mayor. [ ]
61. Other: Whomever catches the head of the decapitated previous rules becomes the next ruler. For 10 years, at which point they themselves will be beheaded. [ ]
62. Cooking contest. The townspeople are served each meal without knowing who prepared it, and vote on their favorite, the logic being that the person who serves the best meal is grounded enough to rule the people well. [ ]"
210,"I was reading old editions of Dungeon Magazine and came across a d50 list of unusual doors. The article is called ""Door Number One, Door Number Two, or..."" by Dan Snuffin from [ep 155]( which came out in November 1986!

I love how retro some of them are, but I could definitely imagine using others in the right situation.

Enjoy the throwback to 80's D&D and feel free to add any ideas of your own!

---

1. This is a standard false door.
2. This door is wizard locked by a 3rd- to 18th-level magic-user.
3. This door gives off an electric shock for 1-4 to 1-20 hp damage.
4. The door is invisible. Player characters take 1 hp damage for walking into the door (1-3 hp if running) and may have some difficulty opening it.
5. The door is a permanent illusion at the 12th- to 19th-level of ability.
6. This door is strongly magnetized; weapons, armor, and other metallic objects stick to the door. A strength roll of some sort (requiring an open doors roll, a bend bars/lift gates attempt, or a combined minimum strength of 15 or more) is required to pull objects from the door. Some objects may already be stuck to the door when encountered.
7. This warm door is red hot. Those who are foolish enough to touch it take 1-6 to 1-20 hp damage.
8. This door is hinged at bottom, held upright only by the door latch. Opening the door releases it to fall and hit the floor with a resounding thud (possibly squashing someone). The noise alerts all within a 150' radius, incurring two additional wandering monster checks. Player characters have a 40% chance of noticing the difference in the door's makeup, 15% if it has false side hinges. Anyone struck by the door takes up to 2-12 hp damage (if the door is of solid steel)
9. The character who touches this door automatically trades places by teleportation with the creature (DM's choice) in the cell-behind that door. A trapped character remains so until some other unlucky soul trades places with him.
10. The door is soaked with a thick, clear acid. Those touching it take 1-4 to 1- 20 hp damage.
11. The good old poison-needle-in-the-lock trap is present p to 1-20 hp damage, with temporary reductions in attributes or death also resulting).
12. This door simply disappears when closed, gone forever.
13. A glass door has been glassteeled (Players Handbook , page 90) here.
14. This is a heavy revolving door covered with sharp spikes. Anyone who gets caught in this one (10% chance per use) takes 1-4 to 1-10 hp damage per round. Characters must roll their dexterity or less on a d20 to escape.
15. For all the listeners out there, here's a door that makes its own noises. What the noises are is up to the DM, but I'm sure that they won't be the same as those coming from what's actually behind the door! Suggestions for sounds: groans, growls, melee. An ear seeker nest wouldn't be a bad idea, too.
16. This door is locked, and any weapon that tries to open it by smashing it to pieces shatters instead. Magic weapons save vs. crushing blow, plus what ever ""to hit"" bonus they might have.
17. This door is locked and cannot be opened or damaged. The only way to open this door is to knock (politely) before entering.
18. This ancient door is so old and rotten that any attempts to open it cause it to collapse (letting the openers fall through). The clatter of wood and metal bindings merits an additional wandering monster check.
19. This door opens easily, but as the first character enters, the door slams in his face (take 1 hp damage with a broken nose)
20. Carved into the wood of this locked door is a staring gargoyle. If the door is forced or the lock is picked, the gargoyle lets out a shrill scream, alerting all within a 200' radius. At least two additional wandering monster checks should be made.
21. No door here — only a mirror. However, this mirror opens like a door. Characters have a 10% chance of discovering it if they are actively searching for secret doors.
22. The character that touches this door is teleported to the door's other side.
23. The door revolves on a horizontal bar set in its middle.
24. This short door is dwarf-, halfling-, or gnome-sized. Man-sized characters may have to shed armor and equipment to squeeze through.
25. This door bursts into flames when touched. The character who sets off this trap takes 1-4 to 1-8 hp damage. The door continue to burn until it goes out (in 2 turns) or it is put out.
26. The door happens to be 5-10' above the floor.
27. This door opens 5-10' above the floor on the opposite side, by means of a dimension door spell. Any character who doesn't look where he's going falls and takes the appropriate amount of falling damage.
28. Under the knob of this door is a sticky contact poison. The characters have a 10-30% chance of noticing the poison, which has variable effects as the DM desires.
29. This tightly fitting door only opens in toward its room. It has no knobs or handles on the other side of the door, so when closed, the only way to leave the room is to smash the door.
30. There is a skeleton hanging on the back of this door. It could possibly be animated to attack, but that's up to the DM.
31. A continual light spell has been cast on both sides of this door for the adventurers' convenience.
32. This door has a permanent silence, 10' radius spell cast upon it. Whatever makes noise on one side of the door cannot be heard on the other side.
33. The door frame of this door is hollow and spring-loaded with bolts. When the door is opened, these bolts shoot out and automatically hit the first person to walk through the doorway. The door frame contains ldlO + 10 bolts that do 1- 2 to 1-6 hp damage each; they fire either individually or all at once.
34. A password is required to open this door. The password should be made accessible to the player characters earlier in the game adventure.
35. The door is covered with blood by some awful creature that has marked its territory.
36. When a character touches this door, it gives off a repulsive rotting odor. Player characters must save vs. spells or wretch and vomit for 5-10 rounds.
37. This door is set upon an invisible wall. Characters take damage (see #4 above) if they walk into the wall.
38. Door is very sticky, and those touching it become stuck. A strength roll (see #6 above) is required to pull free.
39. No door here, just a curtain of complete darkness that cannot be seen through.
40. Door comes complete with an illusionary backdrop, dispelled when someone enters. Common backdrops include an empty room, a bottomless pit, or enough treasure to satisfy any dwarf.
41. To open this door, one must stick a blade in the slot in the door as a makeshift key. The required blade might have to be a certain type of sword (e.g., broadsword, magical sword, dagger, scimitar, etc.), or maybe any sword does the trick.
42. This door can only be opened after a missing part of the door (the doorknob, gold leaf, ornament or some sort, etc.) is replaced.
43. A Leomund's trap has been cast on this door that causes the player characters to believe that something is just not right with it. Of course, there is nothing wrong with this door — maybe.
44. This door does not swing open; characters have to slide it up into the ceiling.
45. A strange music plays when this door is opened and stops when the door is closed (I prefer weird flute music).
46. This wooden door is fireproof, and it may also be resistant to acids and other attacks.
47. This door is inscribed with a glyph of warding that goes off when the door is opened.
48. This door repels all metals. A character must remove all armor, swords, and so forth to open the door, but once this door is opened, metal items may be carried through normally.
49. This door is protected by a demon of the DM's choice. There may be a protective pentagram on the other side of the door, if one can get to it.
50. The first person to open this door simply cannot go through it. Some unusual force (perhaps antipathy) holds him back

Submitted:

1. This door is a jar (trap thingy). Crossing the threshold sends you into a pocket dimension/holding space, frozen in time and expels the last person trapped. [/eDaveUK]
2. This door leads to another door, which leads to another door, which leads to another door, which leads to another door, ad infinitum until the character goes to open the door hits the 20th door, which is stuck. At this point, all the doors behind them begin slamming shut rapidly. When the most previous door closes, the 20th door opens, spitting the character back out of the door they first entered. [/SobiTheRobot]
3. A door that halves or reduces the size of you and everything you carry when walking through it. The effect might be reversed by walking through it from it other side or you need to find another door with the inverse effect, up to the DM. The effect can be permanent or temporary and it can be used to create nice puzzles. [/Rubikow]
4. This door is portable but hold in place by a magic spell. The door leads to a specific place or another of these doors with the same effect. By breaking the spell and somehow managing to carry the door around, the players can get a portable portal, if the DM allows. [/Rubikow]
5. Door with an overly happy AI. Credit: Hitchhikers Guided to the Galaxy [ /World_of_Ideas]
6. Door with a semi-permeable barrier meant to keep out the environment on the other side while allowing (people, creatures, objects) to pass through. Ex: door leads to underwater area. Water doesn't pass through but people can. [ /World_of_Ideas]
7. This door is connected to a pressure plate and only opens, if a creature or object of the exact weight stands on the plate. The pressure plate might be in front of the door on the ground or on top of a short stone column with a bowl or something, close to the door. [/Rubikow]
8. Depending on their previous actions, this door either rewards a player that passes through it with a shower of 5d10 gold coins or a shower of black, smelly and sticky ooze, that inflicts some negative condition onto the character like slowing it down or poisoning it etc. [/Rubikow]
9. This door is turned sideways and leads into another room where the gravity is changed. [/Rubikow]
10. This door is protected by 3 magic crystals above it. Destroy all 3 to open it. Each destroyed crystal summons another warden creature you have to defeat. [/Rubikow]
11. This door leads to a room with smiling but dumb looking people. Walking through this door heals you completely but reduces your intelligence to 4. Once in the room you are cursed to not wanting to leave the room. If you manage to leave the room, your stats are back to normal. [/Rubikow]
12. This door is a mimic ... oh, the poor adventurer that tries to open it. [/Rubikow]
13. This heavy reinforced door only opens, if a certain amount of gold is thrown into a small hole in the door. There might be an inscription, telling the adventurer the amount of gold to deposit. [/Rubikow]
14. This door has a sphinxs' head on it and of course it only opens if you answer a riddle. [/Rubikow]
15. This door runs around together with a frame. Both are animated and in order to pass through, you have to anchor the door inside the frame, but they refuse to be combined, so the characters need to find a way. [/Rubikow]
16. This door is huge. It is basically a gate with a symbol of water on it. It takes a huge amount of strength to open it. (For example: all characters roll strength and the sum must hit or exceed 20×numberOfCharacters). Alternatively, the gate can be opened by simply sprinkling some water on it. (You can easily change this to fire or air, etc.) [/Rubikow]
17. This door is disguised as a huge painting. You can open it with a mechanism inside of the frame. [/Rubikow]
18. This door is disguised as a grandfather clock. It opens only if the time on the dial is set to the correct time. [/Rubikow]
19. This door petrifies a creature that tries to open it without the correct key. There will certainly be some statues around the door. [/Rubikow]
20. There is a mage trapped in this door, appearing as a 2 dimensional image on the door that speaks to the characters. The mage demands some item from the group that will help her to entertain herself while trapped, in order to open the door. [/Rubikow]
21. This black and white door leads to a mirror image of this room where everything is twisted like in a nightmare. [/Rubikow]
22. This door has various gemstones on it and the inscription ""choose wisely"". Some of the stones are missing and the floor in front of the door is cluttered with dead bodies, all having a gemstone in their hand. The wise choice here is to add a gemstone instead of remove one. Taking one inflicts a huge amount of damage. Putting one in opens the door. [/Rubikow]
23. This door opens to the public bathhouse in a village of Amazons, 3d6 are present, are 12-16th level fighters, and are immediately hostile. [/RollinThundaga]"
211,"DM running the feywild, basically I have a princess of spring archfey living within a massive treehouse where she, her distinguished guests and the servants that serve them party, and politic. Looking to fill this treehouse with rooms.

1. A winery where strange fey alcohol is brewed which delivery bizzare effects to those who consume it

2. A room containing a strange fey pet, this pet is not supposed to get out nor is it so nice to visitors

3. A room full of illusions intended as an art gallery its not always exactly non harmful to on lookers

4. A BDSM chamber stocked with all associated equipment 

5. A room full of mirrors that scry into other chambers in the castle

6. A tea room, for tea, except all of it is alive. The wallpapers are layered butterflies which occasionally flap their wings, the chaise lounge is an oyster, the table is a frog, the chairs are large stickbugs, etc.

7. A workshop where a captured mortal toils to make perfect stringed instruments for the Princess. The mortal is cared for, has a small bed for sleeping, and their needs are met, but has not left this workshop since they were first brought here years ago and cannot leave per the Princess’ royal decree.

8. A room that is filled with loose paper, inkwells, quills, and one dozen awakened monkeys currently attempting to write a novel all about the princess. They have all hit a writers block.

9. A locked broom closet. Inside are 12 sentient Brooms of Flying that all wear sand-which board signs that say “UNFAIR WORKING CONDITIONS” “DON’T SWEEP US AWAY”. If the door is unlocked, the brooms immediately fly around the castle and start to cause a mess.

10. A locked room with a miniature version of the treehouse castle in the center, surrounded by 4 display cases and a DO NOT TOUCH sign.

11. A room that appears to be an actual forest. You can see a strange sky, there are no walls but doors stand where they logically should and lead back to the castle.  Windows show you the ""real"" world outside. The forest is bigger than the room should be and you can wander off into it.

12. A wine cellar with a thousand bottles. Mortals get drunk from even a small mouthful.

13. The RP room. Previous guests have been turned into miniatures so the Archfey can have custom models to okay their D&D and other RPGs.

14. The Dungeon. Because every good castle needs one in case of uppity servents/guests.

15. A plain undecorated and empty room. What could it be for?

16. A Windowed Greenhouse room, full of potted flowers, vegetables, herbs, and some dangerous plants you probably should keep distance from.

17. An extraordinary kitchen with all the bells and whistles to feed a small army, many of appliances are custom made and may create magical alternations of the food. The sheen and color is divine.

18. A glamorous theater with a stage, A large crystal floats above the seating that when awakened with magic can display movie like images onto the stage backdrop.

19. A large room piled near the ceiling with toys and gadgets any child would dream of.

20. A star observatory with wall hung drawings of star constellations, planets, and stars. There are a lot of messy writings trying to put together a story of what the cosmos is communicating to this star reader. The room really comes to life at night with glow in the dark decorations and pixies dance around the area to enjoy the cool night air.

21. A trophy and achievement room. Walls and room neatly decorated with trophies, badges, and framed pictures of achievements they made in their life. If the archfey is nearby, the items come to life and vocalize that celebration.

22. A room with an intricately guarded glass box with several layers of magically protected doors, traps, & personal guards. Behind the glass box is a wrapped piece of candy and written on the glass says ""In case of emergency"".

23. A play area with swings, slides, that inflatable castle you jump in, a seesaw, etc...

24. A room of devotion, this room is full of memorabilia, candles, pictures of a fey wild court member. It could be a crush or obsession, who knows."
212,"A character has the ability to make cartoon events happen.   What are some examples of this effect

1.  An anvil falls from the sky

2.   A portable hole is created

3.   A mural can be traveled through by the character but not their opponent

4.  A truck flies by

5.  They produce an exploding cigar"

A player wants to have a mimic backpack - I need tips for interesting encounters

First off, let me clarify. I’m not asking if this is a good idea or if I should allow it. We’re all well experienced and I’ve already explained it’s not a Familiar or Pet that they control. It’s an NPC which I control.

**What I’m looking for are ideas for mischief this mimic can cause.**

The group is five Level 7 characters. They found this mimic in a dungeon. He’s a lazy mimic and small and sentient/smart enough to realize Adventurers are scary/dangerous, so he made a deal with the party; *bring me food and I’ll tell you everything I know about this dungeon, where all the traps and treasures and monsters are that I know of*

For the last four sessions, this has been really fun. They feed him, and he tells them things like, “*up the stairs and to the left is a magically trapped door. It’s electrocuted someone three different times so I ate them. There’s probably something valuable behind it.*”

They figure out a way past the trap, go into the room, fight some giant spiders, and get a magic wand and some gold from one of the corpses in the webbing.

They feed the spiders to the mimic and he tells them about another place.

So now they know they’re getting close to clearing it out, and they’ll be leaving but they don’t want to leave their buddy the mimic to starve or get killed by other Adventurers, so the Thief decides he wants the mimic to be his backpack, figuring the stickiness means it won’t fall off or get stolen and they can keep their gold and stuff safe. 

I’m loving the idea. But this mimic has never been out in the civilized world before. And he’s always hungry.

But I’m hoping for other funny/silly but not totally stupid/bad mischief it can get into.

Any ideas? Thanks!

1. Obviously I’m going to have him slip away and eat a ham at the butchers

2. Eat a chicken (or two) on a farm

3. Eat the kettle of beef stew in the tavern. 

4. Pretend it’s a stool and change its size (smaller) or move when someone tries to sit on it.

5. Change color or material while the Thief is talking to people. “*Wasn’t your pack green?*”

6. You enter a tavern and find a table. The mimic slips off and sets on the floor near your chair like a normal backpack. Unfortunately, being so sticky, it accidentally catches a serving girl by the ankle and she spills her tray of ales all over the group of Half-Orc mercenaries at the table next to you.

7.  It's being trained to associate ""information = food."" When it runs out of real information, it starts making things up. ""There's a trap on the path up ahead. Trust me...""

8. The adventurers notice some of their magic items are moist, as the mimic finds them tasty, but is too afraid to eat them, so settles on licking them at night.

9. Have it constantly try to correct the thief when he tries to deny things. ""I didnt steal that sword!"" ""Yes you did""

10. when it gets hungry it starts salivating and coats everything inside the backpack with drool.

11. It occasionally chews on the hair of the person wearing it.

12. If ever left unattended in a inn room or something similar, have a drool coated clothes next to it when they come back, have it insist it was a thief.... it may or may not be telling the truth.

13. it occasionally grows a eyeball and winks at a nearby bypasser, just to mess with them.

14. Have it eat cats, dogs, other random pets, and occasionally burp up the parts in inopportune times.

15. Sunlight doesn't agree with it and causes it to lose control of its mimicary. Every so often roll a D100 and have it become a different random object for 5 mins e.g. a chest of drawers, an enormous orange parrot (like at least 5ft tall), a portrait of the local lords daughter in bed with the stable lad etc.

16. Perhaps it learns from the rogue and starts wanting to help. It does this by stealing anything that's not nailed down e.g. items in shops, customers money etc. This could be a good thing (free stuff) or a bad thing (shopkeeper notices a sentient backpack trying to steal their +1 Greataxe, as the axe seems to be walking out of the shop by itself).

17. Maybe animals can smell it and know it's not a backpack. Cue horses behaving badly and bolting, dogs barking at the backpack alerting guards etc.

18. Sleeping and snoring at inconvenient times.

19. The players get invited to a local lord's house. The lord wants to hire them. He's also an avid collector of exotic birds.

During said audience, a favourite bird goes missing. The mimic backpack denies having eaten it and insists that one of the other guests also has a mimic on their person.

Plot twist, the mimic is actually the lord's mute warforged butler. Rather, the warforged butler is a mimic colony with each of them pretending to be a different part. They've been stealing food from the lord's pantry knowing NOBODY would suspect a warforged of stealing food.

20. In a shop, the mimic will stick out a tongue and snatch up an item on a shelf to eat. If the shop owner notices the item is missing the party are the prime suspects

21. For whatever reason the mimic refuses to enter the room. It grows in size so it is too wide to fit through a door.

22. Turns itself into a bedroll to see if anyone notices before the get in

23. The adventurers notice some of their magic items are moist, as the mimic finds them tasty, but is too afraid to eat them, so settles on licking them at night.

24. -A thief tries to steal the pack and gets stuck to it. In its panic/in defence of both himself and his buddies items the mimic tries to eat the thief.

25. The mimic begins to see the new and interesting foods available in civilisation. Begins pestering to try them. If the food isn't got for them will try and take it for themselves.

26. Since the group (or it’s “buddy”) is nice to the mimic it decides to try and pay them back. It does so by pretending to be other people's bags in inns, taverns and other situations people will drop their stuff into their bags and not necessarily pay full attention to it. Basically subtly stealing many varied objects for the group.

27. Takes a liking to bag form but demands to be shown/sneaks out to look at other bags. The fancier the better. May be mixed up with a one of a kind bag made on commission for a noble.

•	⁠becomes jealous of bags it's believes are prettier than it so eats them.

28. •shrieks at Clerics

29. catcalls random NPCs

30. boos Bards

31. insists tavern owners are liars

32. turns into a ball, rolls into the street, bites kids

33. helps party members cheat at cards

34. teeny tiny massages at the worst possible moments

35. whenever it sees any animal it asks, ”Is that a dog?”

36. eats the first magic missile that comes near the rogue during combat and doubles in size for 1d4 hours

37. yells knock-knock jokes

38. asks NPCs, ”ya got any gum?”

39. ends each day by telling the PCs goodnight individually and guessing what they’d taste like

40. Whenever the PCs are discussing a plan, it asks, *”Why don’t you just disguise yourselves as common, unassuming pieces o’ furniture?”*

214,"Trying to make a short and sweet campaign based on the Tower Of God series where each floor contains a different challenge.

1. A hunger games style combat where players combat challenge where players try to survive the longest

2. King of the hill, players defend a hill while opponents try to knock them out for several rounds

3. Pick a picture, players are told to pick a painting to bring back to the administrator, they are not told anything but that only the right painting will allow them to pass

4. Fighting clones of themselves

5. Survive a round of long range attacks while trying to cross a bridge, if any of them falls the entire group fails.

6. You arrive at the top of a flight of stairs and see a large wooden door across the landing, a few feet away. The moment your party is fully on the landing, everything else disappears into darkness. *Players can fumble for the door with a low chance of success or jump from an edge with a high chance of success. Success means moving to the next floor. Failure on the door initiates a mimic fight. Failure on the jump does damage.*

7. You climb up the stairs and pass an exhausted party. Two floors later, they catch up and attempt to steal your weapons.

8. You reach the top of the stairs. Exhausted by the climb, your party ponders waiting by a roaring fire in a large brazier in the corner. Eventually, you hear a grinding noise as the wall on the other side of the room advances.

9. You open the door beyond the edge of the last step. A bright light shines. The door opens onto a beach. Behind the door, which disappears as your party passes through, is a dense jungle. Torches guide the party to a deeply forested temple. The temple gates open onto a stairway that you cannot see the end of. *DM adds monsters at will, throughout, if wanted.*

10. Your party crosses the threshold to a small wooden walled room with a small door on the other side. Your party can pass through, but only one at time. As the first party member passes through, a crossbow bolt *THOCK*s into the doorway by their head. Sniper attack! It's a large, shadowy room with roosts at every corner.

11. You arrive to see a table set with a feast. The food provides no nutritional value, but it is delicious. The party fights nightmares after falling asleep at the table. Once awakened, an exit appears.

12. You arrive to an overlook. You can see a large gear works with hundreds of gnomes. It is unclear what the gear works do. A gnome on stilts in an ornate uniform tells your party to get to work. You ask what the work is, and they tell you to move the gears. You ask what that does, and they don't know. The gnomes attack. *An observant player might notice that the gears never stop moving or even slow down when the gnomes abandon them to attack.*

13. A single person, chained by magic is trapped on the floor. There is enough food on the floor to feed a village for 100 years. The door to the next floor won't open unless the person trapped there either dies or is replaced by another.

14. A long corridor lined with magic items and relics. A sign at the beginning says ""Take only what you need and nothing more"". At the end of the corridor past a massive door is a throne room. A warrior king sits on the throne stopping those from reaching the door behind his throne that leads to the next floor. (the door will not open if more than 1 magic item is taken, if no items are taken allow the party to take 2 items)

15. The floor is a small abandoned town. Ruined buildings scatter the landscape. Undead skeletons and zombies fight each other over lies once told in the past. The door to the next floor will open once either all the skeletons or all the zombies disappear.

16. A floor that has 3 doors. One leads to the next floor. The other leads them to a pit of giant snakes. The final leads them down two floors (This door vanishes once walked through). Each door has a sign above it saying where it leads.

17. A floor that starts off on the top of a massive mountain that pierces the clouds. 5 groups enter at the same time. Only the first 2 to make it to the bottom can pass. Only 1 person from each group needs to reach the bottom (they need not reach the bottom alive). 

18. A floor filled with a massive ocean. Hundreds of thousands of marine life live within the ocean. The group starts on a fishing boat and must catch an animal weighing at least 20kg. The higher the weight of the catch the bigger the reward.

19.The door to this floor seems to give onto an exterior: a city square, devoid of all life and dead silent. Its scale and openness easily defy the proportions of the tower's interior. A portcullis, the only apparent exit, stands open on the square's far side, some hundred meters away. On approach, a distant alarm bell rings and guardsmen pour forth and accost the party, urging them to lay down their arms. If a fight ensues, they will continue to emerge in waves of ten until the party surrenders, whereupon they will vanish, and the portcullis will be replaced with the door to the next floor.

20. Invisible traps 

21. Pick a gauntlet , all but one are cursed and there's a q and a with a being to decipher which does what. One of them opens the door.

25. An illusionary painting on all four walls that turns this room into a large forest . Dryads are trying to charm the party into walking off into the woods with them and becoming lost. 

26. Zombie horde room 

27. Indiana Jones style giant rolling rock room .

28. Mirrors - or portals? You're not sure which is which but the reflections in the portals try to pull you in.

29. The Floor of Fire: the floor is literally lava.

30. The Floor of Earth: The floor is filled, floor to ceiling, with dirt.  How does the party figure out where the exit is, and how do they dig their way to it?"

216,"I got tired of designing complex puzzles and solutions because my players had much more creative ways of solving them than I ever could. Now, I just put something in front of them and give them the victory when they do something that makes sense.

So with that said, let’s create d100 riddles/puzzles that don’t really have a defined solution.

For example;

1. Scratched into the locked oak door is a poem.  

*Tears at night*   
*No moon in sight*   
*The pouch is light*   
*But are you right?*

2. The lock has three keyholes- a round one flanked by two oval ones. On the floor are three round keys- a brass one, an iron one, and a silver one.

3. The chest is locked with four latches- two flip up and down, the other two go side to side. The note says;

*First before last*  
*not too slow, not too fast*  
*the compass points past*  
*the riches be vast*

*Last before first*  
*The dam doth burst*  
*The Treasure be cursed*  
*T’would be the worst*

4. There’s a riddle on a brass plaque next to a locked door.

*He who enters*  
*Sight unseen*

5. Twelve iron statues stand guards. As you approach, one speaks-

*Only one pure of pride*  
*May raise the gate to get inside*  
*But should any filled with less*  
*attempt to pass the-*
***a shrill whistling sound pierces the ears***

6. A large glass jar on a table has 6 red stones in it. There are 4 blue stones on the table. The locked door has a yellow hole in the center just large enough to fit a stone.

7. The party finally discovers the hidden treasure room deep within the dungeon. It’s a large, circular room ten feet in diameter. The floor of the room is the door to the vault. It has three large dials in a triangular pattern, equidistant from each other and the wall. Turning a dial requires a successful STR check DC:20. They quickly learn that turning only one dial causes an imbalance and part of the ceiling collapses down. Only by turning all three at the same time can they maintain stability without the entire dungeon collapsing in on them.

Dial 1 has letters around it. A, D, E, P, V

Dial 2 has numbers around it. 1, 4, 8, 9

Dial 3 has shapes around it. Square, Circle, Oval, Pentagon, Hexagon, and Rhombus

The clues are-

*An eye, an ear, a tooth, a toe*  
*back and forth, to and fro*  
*up and down, above, below*

*An arm, a leg, a foot, a hand*  
*the wind, the sea, the stars, the land*  
*life and death are neither planned*"

218,"Uniforms show allegiance and create a distinct impression; less reputable 'armed organizations' might also want to hide their faces and put on a fearsome front while they're at it. This list is to create as many distinctive 'non-uniform uniforms' for bands of ne'er-do-wells as possible.

1. Skulls- Probably animal, but you know there's plenty out there who hold nothing sacred and would use that of their fellow man. Although it did little to protect whoever they got it off of, making your enemies stare into the face of death as they look at you creates an imposing presence.
2. Rough hewn sacks- conceals the identity and imitates the visage of a scarecrow.
3. Warpaint- applied as a pre-battle ritual, it may also have the effect of breaking up facial features to intimidate or camouflage.
4. Iron mask or scolds' bridle- A choice for desperate men without resources, these and other worn torture equipment modified into crude armor poses many questions. Are they recent escapees from a cruel dungeon? Are the inmates running the prison?
5. Large hoods- Worn correctly, they can shroud the face in shadow, creating uniformity through anonymity.
6. Animal hide- the namesake of the berserker. Common choices are boars, bears or wolves, but you know someone who skinned an owlbear and now wears his face like a hat means bad news.
7. Grotesque Visor- A Helmet's visor styled to look like an animal, monster or demon.
8. Woven reed masks, covered with dried mud of different colors, in the style of demon faces, to scare off evil spirits. \[/[EmpedoclesTheWizard](
9. Bandit Bandana  -  Bandana tied to cover the lower half of the face- Plain and simple or with patterns. Even large grinding teeth to intimidate. \[[World\_of\_Ideas](  [texmex42]( \]
10. Bandit  Eye Mask  -  Bandana or other cloth tied to cover the eyes or upper half of the face.  It has eye holes cut in it so the wearer can see. \[[World\_of\_Ideas](
11. Cloth Wrap  -  Cloth wrapped around the head and face leaving only a slit for the eyes.\[[World\_of\_Ideas](
12. Conical  Hat  -  A reed or wicker hat covers the wearer's face.  It has eye  slits so the wearer can see. Think Kung Fu Theater Style.\[[World\_of\_Ideas](
13. Helmet   -  A metal helmet that covers most or all of the wearer's face.   Usually has a distinctive shape or has a distinctive symbol emblazoned  on it.\[[World\_of\_Ideas](
14. Plague Doctor Mask  -  A  leather mask that covers the nose and mouth.  It give the appearance of a  beak.  The eyes are covered by goggles. Some probably go up for sale after a plague ends. \[[World\_of\_Ideas]( [823ballpoint](
15. Wooden Mask  -  A simple wooden mask shaped and decorated to look like an (animal, devil, monster, oni)\[[World\_of\_Ideas](
16. Wooden planks, ( think gothi fools gold ) \[[texmex42](
17. Burkas and similar clothing. \[[texmex42](
18. Face prosthetic. Think large fangs, Intricate horns , nose add-ons \[[texmex42](
19. Fake beard, mustache \[[texmex42](
20. Eye patches \[[texmex42](
21. Half decorative mask ( think someone with half face burned, or Not the Brave's porcelain mouth piece ) \[[texmex42](
22. Tie a scarf around your nose and mouth - Covering \~50% is better than covering 0%. (Used by some gangs to show allegiance, like the french Apaches- OP)\[[823ballpoint](
23. Armoured helmets - Always have your war face on.\[[823ballpoint](
24. Enemy uniforms dyed another colour - What better way to taunt your foes than by repurposing their very clothing?\[[823ballpoint](
25. Clown facepaint - Evil clown, classic.\[[823ballpoint](
26. Wrap your head in bandages - Upside is cheapness and creepiness. Downside is that the bandages tear easily.\[[823ballpoint](
27. Sock and buskin (comedy and tragedy masks) - I'm sure you can come up with some sort of symbolism.\[[823ballpoint](
28. Manticore spines strung around a headband which covers the face, somewhat painful to wear.  \[[2Stressed2BeBlessed](
29. Masqurade ball masks to mock the upper class.\[[2Stressed2BeBlessed](
30. Porcelain masks painted like doll faces for creepiness. Or maybe their leader is a possesed doll.\[[2Stressed2BeBlessed](
31. Goggles with tinted shades and aviator helmets because this group rides high speed vehicles or creatures.\[[2Stressed2BeBlessed](
32. This  group deploys smoke bombs or fog effects to quickly hit and run without  being seen, using green gloves to quickly identify each other in the  dense fog.\[[2Stressed2BeBlessed](
33. This group is cursed  with lycanthropy, shifting into werebeasts to strike at targets and then  shifitng back into their normal indenties when safe.\[[2Stressed2BeBlessed](
34. Crystal necklaces that create a blinding light that makes it hard to look at  the wearer's face but allow the wearer to see just fine.\[[2Stressed2BeBlessed](

219,"Hello ! I am working on the fortress of Geryon and I have (and lack) some ideas to create it. This will help us to design creative dungeons to challenge our players !

I'll keep this thread up to date by taking your suggestions in this post.

So let's go :

1. A portal room (going the material plane or somewhere else).
2. A sacrificial room where souls are harvested and sacrifices made.
3. A throne room, beautiful and giant (perfect for a boss fight).
4. Some pits.
5. A prison which hold an angel/deva or important prisoners.
6. A room with a powerful demon, chained to a magic circle within a machine, its energy being continuously syphoned off to power the facility. Why don't you let it out to play with the facility's devils? Could provide for a fun distraction, as long you don't get in its way. (Alternatively, it's a celestial).
7. A library of contracts. 
8. Trap assembly room. some working, some not
9. A casino that is permitted to be the only place nearby with fresh air and good food. An area enchantment makes the place seem cleaner, and it warps the patrons' perception of time so that they don't realize how long they've been there. A successful intelligence save to see through the enchantment also reveals the NPC patrons to be tortured souls, unable to sleep, locked in an endless loop of feeding coins into slot machines.
10. Garrison for minor devils
11. Feeding room, because cafeteria is too civilized for what is going on in there
12. Ritual room, prepared but no ritual going on. Containers for all of the resources, instructions that can be coppied (Though you try to understand the purpose of these instructions, it will take more time than you have right now to parse them, you can copy them for later)
13. Map room. After Geryon was deposed, they are planning to return to their rule and tracking important events on a series of maps.
14. Hunting/Trophy room. Geryon is an avid hunter and will have an impressive amount of trophies in cases and mounted on the wall
15. A torture chamber with a lot of rusty spiked chains and a chain devil torturer.
16. A room with holding cells that they place the fresh devils that they've fished out of the Styx. This allows time for the effects of the Styx to wear off before the devils are indoctrinated and shipped off to their duty stations. 
17. A sewer space where the devils dump their trash/dead. The captive oozes there keep it clean(ish). A risky way to sneak into the fortress.
18. A sweltering office space with no windows and low ceilings, cramped with low ranking devils, chained to their desks, who are eternally making copies of paperwork by hand. Overseen by a mean Erinyes with a whip.
19. A torture chamber with a lot of rusty spiked chains and a chain devil torturer.
20. A facility that sucks the souls out of captured demons, mortals, celestials, and devils condemned for crimes, and uses those souls in order to mint soul coins.
21. A warmachine factory.
22. A warmachine garage.
23. A warmachine repair shop.
24. A warmachine chop shop.
25. A succubus and incubus style ""break"" room there for the entertainment of all who seek it. If a non-tower worker enters can be made to make checks to make it back out. 
26. A room with an unknown device that connects with others all across the Planes. The Devils like using free time starting arguments between others. (It's basically a chat room or Reddit). 
27. A room where visages of all the people you have wronged curse at you and list a litany of the crimes you have done to them.
28. A room filled with images of your family, begging to be released from hell. These are illusions, but are believable thanks to a powerful enchantment that reads memories.
29. A kitchen where all manner of horrible and dreadful foods are prepared. The cruelties and evil of Hell are displayed.
30. A festering pit that stores the least of all demons who spawn from the dammed souls of mortals. They struggle in the pits until they can consumer one another and evolve or until Geryon selects one for torture, punishment, or advancement as fits the moment.
31. I side this room a wildfire spirit is trapped in a cage. It takes the form of a monkey with fire rippling across its body. For some reason the stone walls have little smudges on them, it quickly becomes apparent why as the flaming monkey throws its ignited feces at the party while wcreeching at the top of its lungs.
32. A room with toilet booths, with the most pungent stench imaginable
33. I think there can be several kinds of torture chambers specific to a kind of enemy. Maybe the cries of a child and virgin blood for a celestial. Definitely iron and salt for fey. Maybe adamantine chains/tools for certain animated constructs. A room filled with happiness for abberations. Cold steel bindings and equipment for demons. An anti magic zone for particularly powerful mages.
34. A room in which several phylactreries are stored of powerful liches that are blackmailed with it. Adventurers can steal them as a bargaining chip or destroy them.
35. There should definitely be a room with cages containing particularly vital subjects, who are being cared for well. Of course only with the end goal of Geryon stealing their vitality.
36. A library of lore. With this lore Geryon can lure powerful individuals to his domain (as unknowing prey). 
37. A door with a sign forbidding entry, when players try to open the door they find themselves unable to as the lettering of the sign is enchanted with an ancient commanding spell, those who can't understand it can easily enter and taking the sign off works for everyone.
38. The janitors closet, cause every place needs someone to keep it clean.
39. Stairs to an upper floor but they go downwards.
40. Soul Room, High value souls are entrapped in crystal form are organized here like a library or collection
41. Classroom of evil, Infernal themed class room where diagrams and books on how to be more evil, cruel, or to get a contract signed by a willing victim.
42. War room, A map of the material plane continent, with full of portrait images of people they are influencing and how their plot is unraveling and progressing. Colored lines are tacked on between each image showing a connection of some kind. Demonic influence project management at it's best.
43. Lava room, A method to create a sauna or torture device with several pools of lava and booth style seating creating an extremely hot room.
44. Infernal Art Room, Shows paintings, drawings, or 3d art of torture, fall of celestial being, corruption, sensuality, nudeness, gore, and demonic glory.
45. Flesh Corpse Workshop, A room used to create all kinds of Flesh constructions and the tools to do it. It smells like meat, blood, and rotten flesh.
46. Cursed Weapon Forge, All the practical materials, tools, and needs to make a cursed weapon. An intimidating infernal forge beckons any capable craftsman. Relentless pain, terrible nightmares, and deepest regrets are some of the most crucial ingredients.
47.  An underground river that the players must cross to continue. There is a small rowing boat to cross it, except for the River of Sorrow. You must roll 1d5 to determine the type of the river: 

&#x200B;

1. River of Hate. A legion of condemned souls inhabit the waters of the river, and will try to sink the players into its depths.
2. River of Fire. It is not a river of water, but boiling blood. In its surface, an undying fire burns. Obviously, touching the river damages the players.
3. River of Oblivion. A peaceful river with calm water, but no less dangerous. Everyone who drinks its water suffers the curse of oblivion. The victim losses 2 levels and if they are a magic caster, they also forget their learned spells for the day. Additionaly and at the discretion of the Game Master, they also forget something important: their own names, their family, their companions, what are they doing here, etc.
4. River of Pain. It's an unhealthy place, almost a swamp. Its banks are muddy and full of reedbeds. Everything that touches the water sinks in its depths, like if it were a quicksand.
5. River of Sorrow. Pretty shalow, it can be crossed on foot (so it is the only river without a boat). However, a dense mist prevents the players from seeing far away. In the fog, the players see visions of the mistakes of their past: like a brother who died and blames a player for not saving him.

220,"Hi everyone! 
I want to help my players to branch out a bit, what they can do with their characters. And see a double use for them as ""what does a NPC try to achieve right now"". They don't should be too specific, but must be very clear when they are achieved. In the end, it's about bragging rights and ""prompts"".

They can be generic or leaning into my setting: SCIFI post-post apocalyptic (the survivors - less than 20 million scattered on the whole earth - of humanity is in the process to reclaim and rebuild their civilizations and use a mix of very high-tech and very low tech solutions (depending on location/faction) to do that while dealing with each other and dangerous drones as well as a fast cooling earth)

It would also be interesting to classify them (in any category you think it could fit).

222,"Ok choombas, the guys are here with the guns and you have a couple of seconds to hit the deck behind something thick or big enough to avoid bullets. What are you jumping behind?

Alternatively, what hazard is there on the field to make your life worse? 

I'll take the easy ones out of the way. I also won't be marking it with a flair because I figure a wry sense of humour is important to a Cyberpunk experience, but not completely necessary either, so be as funny as you want.

1. A bulletproof glass 

2. A wooden bar filled to the brim with delicious, low quality booze

3. The ground here has so many cigarettes that it's become slippery

4. A conveniently chest-high wall. Optionally there appears ""Autosaving"" on the corner of your vision

5. Someone's car, either the door or the windows. 1 in 6 chance of catching on fire if shot at, if it's on. It'll then blow up in 1d6 rounds. If not, it'll create a pool of gas (or flammable non-gasoline, setting-appropriate fuel) that can be really problematic

6. A huge dumpster. Careful, there might be someone sleeping there

7. A wall or door, duh. 

8. Turn the damn table / furniture over and hide behind it - cans and dirty takeout boxes fly everywhere

9. The glass from the window has turned the floor here into something you should definitely avoid stepping in barefoot - or falling into

10. A fridge, it's as sturdy as I can hope. Alternatively, you can also turn it over to create a puddle of milk / water / varying weird liquids on the ground

11. A totally real and not artificial tree, choomba

12. The wires from the computers here became a sort of tripwire hazard

13. An open window nearby provides the ideal chance for defenestration

14. A body, either incapacitated or dead. Provides surprisingly good blast coverage, and also a terrible tripping hazard.

15. The blood from the body has made the ground slippery here

16. So many bullet casings are now like marbles on the damn ground

17. Telephones are constantly blaring, making it very hard to concentrate

18. One of your shots goes astray and hits the light, which now has started flickering and making life harder for everyone. Nice going, choomba!

19. A shot gone astray hits a ceiling fan. It was probably spinning, and it definitely hurts.

20. You thought hitting the wall behind the guy wouldn't be too much of an issue. That's because you forgot that plumbing is a thing, and now there's water gushing out from there and making a mess of things.[

223,"Hi creative hive mind!

My players, through some fault of their own, are stuck in Feywild. I think that a fey menagerie would be a fun encounter. Either for the players to go with them to a court/city or as a way back to the Material plane.

However, I find myself stuck when it comes to artists, exhibitions, attractions and games they can run into. I have seen the Witchlight Carnival but I want more! I do appreciate if some has dark/mean/sad streak as well.

The players enjoy role-playing and puzzles, but will not back down from a fight if necessary.

So far all I have is:

1. The Tumbling gnomes: They call themselves a family, but they bear no resemblance to each other.
2. A merfolk who appears stuck inside the magic bubble of water they are inside, but can it walk outside it, who knows?
3. Pixies, handling the lights on stage and can put on a light show so dazzling the audience seem to be ignoring what goes on around them (might loose small items or find new ones afterwards).
4. The Parrot of Prestidigitation. I think this one speaks for it self ;)
5. The crossbow game for kids: An enchanted bow that let the kids always hit a target and win a small prize. Run by an old, round, man with a big white beard and a jolly laughter.

6. A (insert race) (insert class) that they know, and who has gone missing, is in a cage as a freak sideshow exhibit. \[/Adventux\]

7. Transmutation exhibit. You give them two gold coins, and they give you the freshest air, ever! \[/Arkenstihl\]

8. Fey snack table: there are cookies in the shape of creatures.   
You eat one and your face changes to that creature's face. \[/Arkenstihl\]

9. Gambling table where everyone wins! Nevermind the tiny hands in your pockets... \[/Arkenstihl\]

10. Jerry, kidnapped from another plane: a bored man in a tie fills out tps reports while his keepers try to figure out what he means by ""overtime"" \[/Arkenstihl\]

11. A pocket dragon duel. It's either full sized dragons fighting in a pocket dimension or pocket sized dragons fighting in a tavern. \[/Arkenstihl\]

12. Rapping wizards. That's the whole thing. \[/Arkenstihl\]

13. A beautiful woman plays a lute and sings. As you look closer, you realize she is missing an arm,   
but the lute plays on. \[/Arkenstihl\]

14. A large man is dragging a fey child through the square. The child stole food from his cart. \[/Arkenstihl\]

15. Children in uniform sell stale popcorn. They wear glamours indicating the skills they've learned. One is in the corner setting fires. \[/Arkenstihl\]

16. Two drunk guards, one for the royals, one for the city, both bruised as if they had been fighting. They are singing, arm and arm, completely soused. \[/Arkenstihl\]

17. A camel spits on you, turns around, and reveals a second head. \[/Arkenstihl\] "
224,"Doesnt Matter if its Undead, Devils or the Evil Empire next door. The Army came in, defeated the defending Army and City Guard, Incarcerated or Killed all the people in charge and is now in control.

The Civillians are not killed but oppressed by their new management.

1. All the City Gates, the Bridges in the city and the Main roads have Checkpoints where people are stopped and searched
2. A Group of Soldiers beating someone who did not comply with their orders
3. Soldiers are Partying in the Local Tavern. Harassing the Barmaidens
4. The Local Shoemaker has new customers in the Soldiers. Most of them are paying fairly
5. Wanted Posters of City Residents ""Wanted for Treason"" means they have organized a Resistance
6. The Occupying Army throws themselves a Parade. Driving/Riding over the Main Street. City Residents being forced to cheer.
7. Houses and Businesses are Searched without a Warrant.
8. Food is confiscated and rationed out. Enough for the City Residents to survive but the Army getting the Lion Share.
9. People are registered and their Work and skills are recorded. The Regime marks them as ""Relevant for the War effort"" and ""Non Relevant for the War effort"". Relevant Businesses stay open but are probably forced to make discounts for the Army. Non Relevant workers are doing forced labor in farming and mining.
10. The sewers are starting to be cleaned up and used for quick clandestine travel around the city.
11. Propaganda posters and flyers have been showing up all over the city streets.
12. Curfews and other ‘new city ordinances’ (like limiting the size of public gatherings) are taking effect.
13. People are being displaced to make room for new building projects.
14. Occasionally bodies will wash up on shore mangled or deformed in strange ways.
15. Rumors circulate about a coming messiah figure: a religious authority, a true heir of the fallen royal family, etc. Whether this is true or just propaganda by the resistance (or even a trap by the authorities) is up to you.
16. Anyone who knows Thieves' Cant will hear some mixed up messages in the marketplace as the resistance has developed their own version.
17. Businesses belonging to the regime's enemies are marked. Patronizing them is discouraged.
18. Gang of thugs vandalizing homes and businesses of the regime's enemies. Law enforcement watches smugly.
19. Families being rounded up for expulsion to internal or external exile.
20. Graffiti from the Resistance
21. Laws are being applied unfairly. Occupying army can murder a man in the street and no one blinks an eye. But how dare that citizen raise his voice to a Grunt Soldier.
22. Public executions are commonplace. Bodies left to hang/rot to send a message to the people.
23. Zero alcohol to be found in the city. Unless you work for the occupying army.
24. Occupying soldiers run a protection racket on the local businesses. Business owners are forced to pay up or bad things happen to them, their customers, or their businesses.
25. Public (executions, torture) of people who didn't follow the occupying force's orders.
26. A lottery to choose sacrifices for the occupying force's god or to feed their war beast.
27. The occupying force's ""new citizens"" are being branded. Possibly a magical brand that may make them compliant, allow tracking, or restrict their actions.
28. Children are being taken away to be trained as new recruits for the army.
29. People are gathered so the occupying force can announce the new (decrees, laws) to their new subjects.
30. There are squads of patrolling soldiers in small groups

225,"So awhile ago someone posted a merchant who only sold silly magic items that were only in stick and rock form. My players absolutely loved this guy. The problem now is that I cant find the posts. So I need some more fun or dysfunctional magic items that are in the form of sticks or rocks. 

1. Rock of Weather detection - when the rock is wet it is raining, when the rock is hot it is sunny, when the rock is flying then its a tornado...etc.

2. Stick of Invisibility - when a command word is spoken the stick turns invisible.

3. Rock of Goblin Summoning - this rock summons a goblin for a total of 6 seconds. The goblin knows of this and will try to steal whatever he can get his hands on in those 6 seconds. Works once per day

4. Rock of Suicide - a rock that causes a person to kill themselves. The rock must be touched on purpose and not by any other means. Players can't pick up the rock with a towel and touch someone else with it. Picking up the rock with a towel and touching an uncovered part of the rock by accident counts as touching the rock.

5. Stick of being stolen - this stick is constantly being stolen. If a pc picks it up it will be immediately taken by a bird

6. The Neat Rock - when someone touches the rock they feel a compulsion to call the rock neat. Make a DC15 charisma saving throw or you must call the rock neat.

7. Stone of gravity detection! - It is always being pulled towards the nearest gravity source (note, the gravity doesn't have to the affecting the stone, the source of it, like a spell caster or trap, just has to be close enough to it to overcome regular gravity, but it's more fun if you don't tell the players this).

14. Talking Stick - 1/day as an Action, targets cannot speak before you specifically address them, which lasts for the next minute. A target is any creature who is aware of you and could currently hear and understand your speech.

28. Stick of Truth - upon picking up this stick, you must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma Saving Throw. If you fail, you must speak only the complete truth for the next hour. If you succeed, you feel a little strange for a second but otherwise notice nothing else about the stick. The stick has one charge and recharges at dawn.

61. Rock of Ages - will tell you exactly how old someone is if they touch the rock.

62. Nondescript rock - A enchanted rock. When touching it the character must pass a wisdom check or believe the rock is a powerful magical item that needs attunement. If the rock is attunted to, the attuned person realizes it has no other effect. Characters who had previously attuned to the rock always pass the wisdom check.

63. Rock and Roll Rock - This rock has an uncanny ability to never stay still. No matter which way it is placed on a surface it will either roll down the slightest incline or rock back and forth in place.

64. Training stick - No matter what is wielding it or what they do with it the stick can never cause direct harm. Even the strongest swing will feel like a feathery tap to the recipient. It has a hit die of 1d0 and always has a damage modifier of 0. So in other words it can never cause damage mechanically.

65. Stick of levitation - Speaking its command word causes this stick to float a foot in the air. It can only take a weight of a single pound. It can only levitate a total of an hour a day before recharging on sun up.

66. Boomerock (or other applicable boomerang rock pun) - When this rock is thrown, once it hits something it will immediately reverse direction and fly back to the thrower. The thrower must succeed on a dexterity check or be hit by the rock.

67. Snapping Staff (requires attunement) - This is a heavy, stout quarterstaff, and can be used as such. Once per day, the wielder can hold either end in each hand and place the staff over or against his or her knee. Regardless of the wielder's Strength, with a little effort the thick staff impressively breaks in half with a satisfyingly loud snap! Now instead of one quarterstaff, the wielder has two clubs. If the two halves are fitted back together, it magically repairs itself over the next long rest.

68. Sticky Stick - This stick is really sticky. Touching it coats your fingers in a clear residue, and anything your fingers touch will also get residue on it, and it can only be removed during a Short (or Long) Rest. The residue isn't like superglue, so you can't climb walls or anything. It's just sticky enough to be annoying.

69. Rods of Divining Divining -  This is a pair of L-shaped rods. When each rod is held in either hand, the Rods of Divining mystically turn to point to the nearest person using a Rod of Divining, which is the wielder.

70. Whittler's Twig - This is a thick, stubby piece of white wood. Every long rest, the twig regenerates so it is whole again. Great for practicing or for pranking your friend who likes to whittle. Also makes for a great chew toy for a dog or rodent!

71. Bonsai Treant - This is fully mature Treant is only about a foot high, and is planted in a pot. It is not cute or friendly, and blames all humanoids for its plight. It is too small to do meaningful Slam attacks or to throw anything larger than a small stone, but that won't prevent it from doing its best to hurt you. If its attacks fail, it will animate any nearby trees to attack you. If there are no trees nearby, it will resort to saying hurtful things about you. The Bonsai Treant can only be appeased by transferring it from its pot to a forest that is far from any normal-size Treants that will make fun of it.

72. Thirsty Stone - This surprisingly light stone, about the size and shape of a softball, is made of a porous material. It quickly absorbs liquid, much like a sponge, becoming heavier. The liquid seeps out again slowly over the course of about an hour.

73. Stone of Skipping - This broad, flat, smooth stone looks perfect for skipping, and indeed it is. If properly thrown, this stone will skip one more time than a stone of similar shape and weight would if projected at the same angle and speed.

74. Fruity Pebble - Small, brightly colored pebbles are sometimes found among the roots of fruit trees. If you put them in your mouth, or soak them in water, they become pliable enough to chew like a soft candy. They taste like the fruit of whatever tree they were found under.

75. Goblin Stone - To most eyes, this looks like an ordinary rock, indistinguishable from any other rock. But a Dwarf will immediately recognize it as a Goblin Stone and contemptuously cast it aside. It otherwise has no power or effect.

76. Rock of Rock - If you hold this rock up to your ear, you can faintly hear a dude totally thrashing on a Stratocaster. 🤘

77. Pocket Rock - When this small rock is placed into a pocket (or other carried container such as a backpack, etc), it will magically reappear in that pocket or container if discarded, traded, sold, or otherwise gotten rid of by the carrier. The only way to be rid of the Pocket Rock is if someone else steals it without the carrier's knowledge. It then becomes the new carrier's burden until stolen again.

78. The Attractive Rock - Looks very pretty. once purchased and attuned to you, it will start to ""attract"" other rocks to the person. who will eventually die from being buried under the massive number of rocks. This death can be prevented simply by getting rid of the excess rocks, constantly. or with remove curse to get rid of the Attractive Rock. Upside of the the Attractive Rock: Sometimes the rocks it attracts are valuable. 

79. Stick of bug - once per day, can be activated to reveal itself as a 6-inch stick bug and function as such for 10 minutes. Animal handling DC to befriend it, upon a fail it seeks the nearest tree for camouflage.

80. Pet rock - must be pet for a minute every day or it will run away in the night.

81. Rock of through - If you hold it against an object (door or wall) you can see behind it as the rock was a hole.

82. Color-eating stick - A stick that will absorb the color of anything touched by its end, can store about 1 cubic meter of color and needs to be washed in water before used again.

83. Rock of gravity - A rock that tells you if there is gravity around it. if you drop it away from the floor and it floats = there is no gravity. ( just a normal rock, this always get some giggles :v )

84. Bag of sticks and stones - fairly typical mix of 1d10 + 1 sticks and stones. If used as weapons their damage is minimal unless you roll a nat 20, then they break a bone in the target. Each one loses its magic after a use.

85. The river sticks - when tossed into flowing water they drift in the direction of the nearest entrance to the underworld.

86. Stick em up! - This stick will scream the phrase stick em up at the most inopportune times. The stick attunes to you instantly and will scream the phrase out in your own voice. 

87. The Twig and Berries - once attuned the user will try above all to protect the Twig and Berries. In the event that the item is harmed the user takes 1D10 +2 crushing damage and is paralyzed for the round. The user will resist all attempts to release the Twig and Berries, and cannot be convinced except through Remove Curse or the destruction of the item. Any user that attunes to this item will immediately become male, regardless of previous race or sex. This effect is permanent.

88. The tWig - a small twig that when placed on the head of a user creates a new, false set of hair that appears as the user chooses. The tWig uses the stats of a disguise self spell with a DC 12 perception checkb to see through. After donning the tWig any birds in the immediate vicinity will begin attempting to build a nest on the head of the user. The birds will cease their attempts immediately upon removal of the tWig.

89. Magnetic meteor stone - is a very small magnetic stone that is intended for con men to use during games of hide the stone. (Called the Shell game in real life) A local lord lost a small fortune playing this game and has forbidden its practice under penalty of death if caught with this stone.

90. Rock beats scissors - this rock will actively smash any scissors in a 5 ft radius. If someone puts a piece of paper within a 5ft radius, the rock will begin trembling with fear.

91. Rock band - this is a small collection of 4 stones. You can faintly hear the sound of music when these are put up to your ears. Each rock plays a separate part of a song. The rocks only know one song - Rockstar by Nickleback

92. Sticky Fingers - this stick when held for 1 round becomes extremely sticky. A Str check of 22 is needed to remove the stick. Can also be removed with a remove curse spell.

93. Sticky Finger 2.0 - when attuned this stick will begin to influence you to start stealing items in its vicinity regardless of the items worth. A CHA check of 15 is needed to overcome the influence. That number becomes 18 if you already like to steal things.

95. The Measuring stick - this stick will measure anything. Stick it in a cup of water and it will tell you its volume. Stand it up next to a building and it will tell you its height. The stick communicates telepathically and it is wildly inaccurate.

96. Rockette - this small, smooth, green and red rock grants the holder proficiency on unarmed strikes using their feet (kicks).

97. Stick up your ass - this is a completely joke item that your vendor will tell the PCs about after a few of the other items have shown off magical properties. Its sole purpose is make the PCs worried about what it MIGHT do.

98. Dwayne ""the rock""- after touching this stone you instantly know that its name is dwayne.

99. The stick of stick your neck out- this stick is more of a curse. When in someone possession it subtly influences the person to stick their neck out in combat. This gives their opponents advantage on any attack that would cut their head off. 

100. Stick of butter - is it butter or is it a stick. No one may ever know. Either way its good on toast."
226,"Hi everyone,

First Post here,

I’m trying to build a medieval fantasy universe where magic is rare, and only a few women  ( *with some exceptions)* know how to use it properly: witches.

Their magic is not generic ( not every witch knows how to cast a fireball) but more personal and specialized. ex: red moon witch

i’d like to make a D100 list of them :

rules/guideline:

\- It’s ok if they are not named or don’t have a physical description

\- they can have different power levels ( from: i can knit with my mind to burn a whole continent to ashes)

\- The more the better, if you want to add a background/story/legend to the character, do so.

\- Be free if you want to complete an existent entry

I’ll add all your creations/ideas.

Ps: sorry if i made mistakes, english is not my main language. and any tips to improve list accessibility are welcome ( since i'm a beginner here)

11. Granny Ask - An old shepherdess who treats the community around her as her flock. Can probably command lightning and weather in general but won't do it without a damn good reason. Doesn't express herself too well, is unusually quiet and self conscious about it, and sometimes struggles with feelings of inadequacy but puts on a strong face for her flock. Doesn't have a pointy hat, wears a sort of pointy hooded cloak to protect from the rain. Originally born as a man but magic has long since changed that.
12. Old Mother Gar - The Crocodile Hag. Lives deep inside the swamp, has a crocodile head and long claws - either it was a magical accident or she was simply born that way. Likes children but likes even more to scare them stiff. Acts as a sort of Krampus character around the village; ""if you do something bad, Old Mother Gar will take you away"" is what parents say. Very jovial with adults, but is indeed a carnivore and chiefly protects the swamp from evil creatures and ghosts. Her pointy hat is old and battered and made out of straw.
13.  Martinaise the Sorceress - Thinks you can learn magic from books. Wears glasses, has an annoying voice, underestimates any ""hedge magic"" (anything that doesn't come from books), and is deathly afraid of being called a witch - prefers the term ""sorceress"". Treated with vague understanding to open contempt by other witches. 
14.  Martinaise the Sorceress - Thinks you can learn magic from books. Wears glasses, has an annoying voice, underestimates any ""hedge magic"" (anything that doesn't come from books), and is deathly afraid of being called a witch - prefers the term ""sorceress"". Treated with vague understanding to open contempt by other witches.
15. Sir Aureliano - A portly man of around 40 who looks like he once had a very athletic and powerful frame. He was a bachelor knight, the 5th son of a wealthy landowner, who tried his best to prove his worth. Eventually he went looking for his ultimate prey, the Dragon Boi, only to find out that there was no such thing as Boi - the legends were poetic and described the ancient river around that place. This left Aureliano disillusioned, so he went fishing. One day he pulled his net and found a little statue of a dragon in a circle. This provoked a deep enlightenment and Aureliano learned to speak the language of the fish and also made him immortal it seems. He now wanders around the place offering knowledge and encouraging people to seek enlightenment, and calling fish for sailors' nets, while also warning fish to go away from evil men's nets.
16. The Ash Tree - This is the oldest ash tree in the world, even though it's not the tallest. It's so old that it awakened a deep magical conscience in itself and its descendants (to a lesser extent). But its magic operates on a tree's timescale; it can't do anything quickly, but if you hang around its grove you'll find paths have changed (to where you want to go or to send you away depending on your intentions) or that food is easier to come by / scarcer. The Ash Tree can be quite vicious; it has little regard for life or death as it doesn't see that much of a difference between them, and its main goal is simply to grow and spread its seed as far as it can.
17. The Sugarcane-cutter's Daughter - A sugarcane cutter from around this region was working on the field a week ago he found a particularly thick sugarcane. He hit it and found it to be hollow. Inside it there was a baby the size of a closed fist who looked like the most precious thing ever, already with a full head of curly hair and completely black skin - not brown, black as charcoal. He took the baby home and over the next week he found other things in the sugarcane plantation - fine clothes, mirrors, wealth, etc. Every day it seemed like the baby aged 2 or 3 years at a time, learning to speak in her first day and to walk in her second day. Now, a week later, she's a young woman and it seems like she stopped aging so fast. She doesn't have any overt magic except that she's the most beautiful person in existence and can basically charm anyone. She doesn't seem that much interested, though, and the path she'll take now is still up in the air. Her parents want to take her to marry or become a concubine to the sultan / emperor / ruler, but she's still finding herself and would like to taste this world better. Unbeknownst to anyone, in a week (or however long is more dramatically appropriate) time, her godly parents will come to bring her back to their own world, the moon, unless she has found a place in this world. Marrying to the emperor *does not* count as a place in the world.
18. Lucia, or ""Queeny"" - A young, inquisitive child of relatively wealthy peasant parents who was raised by her uncle, Barnabas, and his foreign ""roommate"" and valet, Nastasius. The two basically left the child to roam free in their ranch-atelier on a beautiful prairie, but Queeny found it boring. She liked to explore the ranch and make up stories, and somehow (your choice) she basically willed herself into being a witch. She enchanted her favourite doll, Emilia, to become her best friend, and a corncob to become the pretentious *Vicomte de Maïs* (literally Viscount of the Maize but he pretends Maïs is a faraway land where people are made out of corn).She's also finding out she can breath life in the creations of her imagination and her toys, and so she surrounds himself with a court of her own making where she's the queen. She's a bit stubborn and prone to anger so she might end up giving life to something bad any day now, but she's a good, smart kid who just needs some more friends and a bit of guidance in her gift.Her uncle is completely at a loss on how to deal with this, and he doesn't want to tell her parents because 1. they might ""blame"" him and make their relationship even more frayed, potentially motivating them to cut it off completely, and 2. Little Lucia has demonstrated interest in learning how to paint like him, so if her parents take her back, even if it is to find guidance from a proper witch, she might have all her creativity stifled. Lucia has *some* idea about this, and she really does want to learn how to become a great painter and artist, but she doesn't have the perspective on why this is a big deal.
19.  Gladenna - Dwarven swamp witch hermit. Gladenna of the root staff, servant of none, keeper of runes. Reclusive and generally unwelcoming to visitors, Gladhenna can be convinced to answer questions and prepare charms and spells for persons offering sweet delicacies. 
20.  A witch that lives on a beach (SandWitch?) and has water and sand themed spells/abilities "
227,"Greetings all. With Spelljammer coming out soon, I figured something to start us down that road might be fun.

Essentially I was thinking of this as some fun random encounters as well as possibly some writing prompts to start a larger story/adventure.

<here> is essentially any spot where a ship got stuck, such as, on an asteroid without a helm, floating on the sea, under water, top of a mountain, etc...

Here are a few to start:


1. A single Mind Flayer is stuck on an asteroid because he has run out of slaves to power his life draining helm. The Mind Flayer has been here for a week and time is short. Is he willing to trade anything for help? Or is he willing to find a new ""willing slave"" to power his ship? -- User [SpawnDnD](


2. A ship of varying design is floating in the void lifeless and all the members of the crew are either dead or fled. The air is all but gone. When did this happen? What were they sailing with as cargo? Where were they going? Is anyone on their way back NOW or in the future? -- User [SpawnDnD](


3. You have found a Spelljamming ship at the bottom of a lake. It sunk because it was NOT made to sail in water and was not water tight below the water line. If someone was able to somehow seal those gaps and pump out water, it would float making it east to recover the ship.  When did this happen? What were they sailing with as cargo? Where were they going? Is anyone on their way back NOW or in the future? -- User [SpawnDnD](


4. Under the desert sands is a giant royal barge. on this barge a helm exists and it could be used once its dug up and freed from under thousands of tons of sand. Who owned this? Why is it here? What is in its hold right now and is it still usable? -- User [SpawnDnD](


5. On an asteroid is a crash landed Spelljamming ship that is covered with undead. Its extremely large and has Skeletons, Zombies and a vampire in a coffin in the center of the ship. How did this ship get here? Why is there a Vampire and undead here? -- User [SpawnDnD](


6. You come alone an un-powered Spelljamming ship in the void. Onboard is a  Charismatic (19 Charisma) Gnome who skillfully endears himself to your  party. Why is he on the ship alone? Is he being chased by the  police/authorities for something...like stealing the boat or something  else? Is another criminal organization chasing him for stealing their  money or keeping money? The possibilities are endless why someone so  Charismatic is out here. -- User [SpawnDnD](


7.  You come across a ship that is adrift.  The crew of the ship killed the  captain in a mutiny... only to find that none of the survivors of the  battle were magic users and they could not power the ship without their  former leader at the helm. -- User [heartwarningskeleton](



8. The stranded crew were parking on an asteroid to look at an interesting glowing monolith on its surface. But try as they might, the Spelljammer refused to move even when pushing the [Spelljammer engine equivalent] was pushing as hard as it could. The crew eventually expired never knowing that the parking break was on. -- User [sirkibblesnbits](

75. The next time a weapon is drawn, POOF, it’s now a rubber chicken and pixie dust is everywhere. Squeezing it makes a dumb noise. It turns back after a few rounds.
76. A Satyr follows a person playing theme music.
77. Pixies cast a glamour spell on the ugliest person in the party. Suddenly that PC is a gorgeous female elf.
78. A dryad wishes someone to stay and talk with them. She casts a root spell, if the PC stops for more than a min the PC feet start to root in place.
79. A PC suddenly has a trail of small saplings following him where that PC goes.
80. You are gifted a fire breathing chicken that lays spicy eggs.
81. You are polymorphed into a chipmunk. It can only be broken by you receiving damage.
82. Everyone in the party look like the same person. (it’s who the pixies think is ugliest)
83. Every time a bag is opened it makes a fart sound.
84. Bright lights appear as soon as someone says the word Stealth and won’t disappear until someone not in the party sees you.
85. A rhinoceros is stampeding down the thin path. It’s a pretty obvious illusion without a shadow or footprints that passes through anyone harmlessly if they don’t move. Anyone that the illusion passes through now smells like a sweaty stinky rhinoceros.
86. The party finds a fruit tree growing a variety of fruits and vegetables, even kinds that don’t grow on trees. They are perfectly fine to eat, but none of them taste how they look. (The banana tastes like potato, the broccoli tastes like orange, etc. )
87. Everyone’s ears have been changed into donkey ears.
88. One of the party finds themselves uncomfortable and unable to sleep thus losing the benefits of a long rest and instead becoming exhausted. A single pea placed under their bedroll is the cause. If planted, the pea will sprout into a magical beanstalk.
89. One of the party (any gender) starts to feel increasingly bloated and nauseous over the course of three days. They are far more hungry and crave odd combinations of food. They wake up on the fourth day to find a large egg in bed with them as though they have laid it. The egg eventually hatches into a really ridiculous and ugly leggy bird that runs off laughing (or another creature of the GM’s discretion.)
90. You happen across a traveling merchant offering excellent deals. All his goods and even his change are fake. (transformed sticks, leaves, dirt, old boots, etc.)
91. The party is dumped into a hedge maze that cheats by re-arranging itself.
92. Many small fairies are helping a gigantic elderly snail slowly cross the road. It will take an hour for it to cross. The fairies warn you not to leave the path in the mean time. Will-o’-wisps lurk on the borders as a warning. Anyone who does leave the path hoping to simply walk around the snail finds themselves instantly transported into a confusing and thorny hedge-maze that takes more than an hour to escape from.
93. Your coins have been enchanted with magic mouths to tell bad puns. They insult your poverty, your social status, merchants, and any goods you are trying to buy.
94. Everyone’s boots and shoes are now only left-footed. This fixes after 24 hours.
95. Your team is followed around by a troop of squirrels. Whenever you say a certain, fairly common word, they bombard you with walnuts.
96. Replace all of your arrow heads with red berries. (If first pulled out in battle the PC might not notice before firing one or two.)
97. The afflicted player REALLY needs to sneeze, but can’t.
98. The entire party gets the hiccups.
99. The afflicted player feels uncomfortably warm, no matter the environment.
100. The afflicted player has an itch in an unreachable part of their back. Whoever itches it is afflicted next.
101. The PCs’ clothes become bound to their bodies and turn into dancing outfits. The PCs also lose the ability to speak and always dance when trying to move, battle or interact with something. Lasts one day.
102. The PCs gain traits of various forest animals (deer antlers, squirrel tail, etc.)
103. A random PC’s hands turn into bushes. Strange berries that grow on these bushes also apply that same effect when consumed.
104. The skin and hair of the PCs now have unusual and bright coloring.
105. The PCs are still completely aware, but their bodies are controlled by the pranker. She makes them do sinchronised dancing for 1 hour.
106. A random PC’s hair becomes 10 times longer than before and stops being affected by gravity.
107. A random PC starts to grow long, soft, brightly colored fur out of their neck and wrists.
108. The PCs’ clothes turn into very expencive and beautiful outfits. The PCs also can only use very formal words in a conversation.
109. The PCs are transformed into furniture and dishes needed for a tea party. They can still see and hear, but can’t willingly interact with the world in any way. The pranker and her friends appear out of nowhere to sit down, drink a cup of tea and gossip.
110. The PCs and all their equipment appear black and white to everyone, including themselves.
111. A random female PC gets an unremovable flower crown, but every flower in that crown is 3 times bigger than that PC’s head.
112. The PCs are transformed into tiny pink dragons with glitter breath. The effect lasts for 2d4 hours.
113. The pranker hosts a game show where the PCs are the players, and not getting your hands transformed into tree branches for 7 days is the main prize.
114. Cast prestidigitation to make a black cloud float over someone’s head wherever they go. Including indoors.

Oh, feel free to add more! would love to read!"
229,"Hello fellow adventurers. I had the idea of a session in which players would be trapped in a demi-plane that has a magical aura that causes players to be angry and distrustful towards one another. Basically, high drama. This would then be broadcast throughout the realm via scrying stones or whatever. I wanted to put together a list of trashy reality show inspired drama that players could be enchanted into acting out. I'll try to provide some examples:

1. Someone started a rumor and all your magical items were inherited and not earned.

2. You were left out of the official adventuring party group portrait because you weren't hot enough.

3. The adventuring party is secretly been trying to find a +1 charisma magic item for you because you're so awkward.

4. Someone said you should stick to healing because you don't really know how to do battle.

5. People are saying that the bard you thought was trying to sleep with you was definitely hitting on a different party member

Marking NSFW in an attempt to encourage spicy content."

232,"I've decided that for the cosmology I'm building it would be cool to have each plane symbolize a card from the Major Arcana, but the issue is, 22 planes are a lot and some cards are difficult to come up with a plane for because the symbolism doesn't evoke anything to me immediately. If you can, please provide at least 2-4 sentences to sum up each plane and give them an opportunity to house inhabitants as well. What I'll also do when editing this,  is that if you have an alternate idea for a plane but someone else commented a card already, I'll just enter and tab over.  I'm not gonna be too strict with that because the max limit is already pretty low but I'd still like to have at least one plane for each card, so I'm only going to be counting the first entry for purposes of list completion.

&#x200B;

0. The Fool: The Garden of Delights. A paradise-like plane full of all sorts of worldly delights. Food as much as you want, people gambling, people indulging in not so child-friendly pastimes. Be careful to stay too long though, or you will find your desire to leave dwindle. /ClairLestrange

1. The Magician:The Everlasting Academy The whole plane is a gigantic school, with everything you ever wanted to learn in it. If you are respectful to the teachers and other inhabitants you will be able to learn quite a few skills here. Disrespect them tough and you'll get banished faster than you can say 'but I didn't mean it like this' /ClairLestrange
2. The High Priestess: The Akashic Records. This plane is a library (though it can change mediums. Sometimes it's a video store or a tapestry or a big comic book) of every thought by a living creature, past, present, and future, and thus, their fate. If you have permission of the librarians, you can browse the fates of others,  but the more you view your own future, the more it changes, and so do the futures of others to accommodate for this. That's when they send ""them"" to come and get you...
3. The Empress: A plane full of untamed nature. Thick forests with trees bigger than on any other plane, oceans so deep you'll sink for days without reaching the bottom, and meadows greener and wider than you'll ever imagine. It's a calm and beautiful plane, and the wildlife has no intentions of hurting you. Don't dare to hurt it though, or you'll face the wrath of the untamed wilds to it's full extend. /ClairLestrange
4. The Emperor: The Platinum City, home plane of a major pantheon. After winning a war against the Titans, they hid away up here as a reward, watching over mortals like ants. People who ascend to godhood can easily get up here, so that's why the gods don't like it when mortals ascend. Also, angels are created here, and depending on where they are in *that* hierarchy, they can take on the traits and abilities related to the god they serve.
5. The Hierophant: The Ancient Oracle. The Ancient Oracle. This plane is different to everyone who enters it. For some it's a temple, for others it's a soothsayers' tent. What they all have in common is a hooded figure who will answer all your questions truthfully. You might not want to hear what they have to say though, or even have the slightest clue on how to interpret it. /ClairLestrange
   1. The sunrise dimension. All land is perpetually bathed in those gleaming first rays of sunshine, the mountainous landscape presents a bluish tint as morning mist obscures the broken horizon. In the air, the sounds of speedy creeks and a somewhat comforting breeze of chiling humidity remind (the denizens of enlightenment) of a familial lake side cabin on winterscrest morning. All is serene, righteous and everlasting, perfect for spiritual contemplation and reflection of one's duties and place in the universe. /texmex42
6. The Lovers:The Lover Plane of Existence is a vast and expansive realm where the balance of the physical and spiritual realms meet. It is a place of infinite possibility, a space where individuals can explore their innermost desires and find fulfillment in their true selves. The Lover Plane is made of two distinct yet intertwined realms: the Upper and Lower Planes. The Upper Plane is the realm of the mind, a place of dreams and spiritual growth. It is here that individuals can explore their personal and creative potential, and find solace in their own thoughts and feelings. The Lower Plane is the realm of the body, a place of physical pleasure and sensual exploration. Here, individuals can explore their physical desires, indulge in their passions, and find fulfillment in their personal relationships. /NecessaryCornflake7
7. The Chariot:The trial grounds. For people to approach divinity, the gods devised a plane of tasks and tests. Only those determined to take action, risk everything to move to a higher plane will manage to do so in this inhospitable place. Stalking giant sandstorms, monsters of legend and hazardous plantlife seek to validate the feats and greatness of those who venture through this world in search of the celestial door. /texmex42
8. Strength: An ethereal realm where only the mind/soul can exist, a plane where the denizens exist in a non-corporeal form and thought and emotion are more the physicality and cause direct consequences in the locale. (From the reverse meaning of the strength tarot card “raw emotion”) /SleeperOfRlyeh
   1. a barren, scorching wasteland, poor in resources, where only the strong survive (I imagine something similar to Apokolips, from DC comics). Elemental magic runs wild and often manifests in elemental creatures. /Nikelui
9. The Hermit: The Lakes of Solitude. A calm and quiet plane. It's just an endless lake, speckled with small islands and in perpetual twilight from an early, foggy morning. Everything feels tranquil here, and it's a great place to rest and meditate. On other planes it is rumored that the veil between the worlds is thinner here, and you might be able to get faint messages from people long gone while meditating /ClairLestrange
10. Wheel of Fortune:  The Pit of Turmoil. A souped up version of Limbo, but one where its chaotic nature changes you, too. ""Stepping foot in this plane"" begs change and transformation to all. The beings that survive there have learned how to play The Oldest Game: the wizard's game of transformation where you change into something that will defeat your opponent. Today you might be a snake eating a bird, tomorrow you might be a horse stomping snakes. The world itself follows suit: temperature, rainfall, environmental hazards all change as well. One moment you may be in the hot steamy jungle, and a 5 minute walk later be in windsweped icy tundra, and further on a warm ocean of coral and fish. (Concept: /arthurjeremypearson. Name and reinterpretation for Wheel of Fortune: /ClairLestrange)
11. Justice:A gigantic courtroom, with a diverse selections of judge and jury. The highest judge is a cloaked and hooded, imposing figure seemingly made of pure shadow, and the rest of the judges is made up of gods, fiends, titans and fey. The adventurers are welcome to sit on the gallery and observe the trials of all sorts of evildoers from all over the multiverse. Maybe one or the other reminds them not to do bad deeds themselves..... /ClairLestrange
12. The Hanged Man:  A casino plane where you must always accept what happens to you or face penalty (you can choose how serious to make those) in which all is designed and decided around change, with everything from the justice system to the food being a gamble you can't really predict what will happen next.  /Unequal_Trex
13. Death: The endless Carousel. Arriving on this plane makes it seem like there's nothing but a dusty savannah stretching in every direction. The farther the party walks however, the more they feel the aches of aging. If they press on long enough, they'll wither and turn to sentient dust that eventually forms back into a child, growing older and withering again. This circle continues until they leave the plane, arriving at their destination back in their original age and body. /ClairLestrange
14. Temperance:A clinical environment similar to a hospital or psychiatric facility, in which denizens take the roles of patients or healers, here visitors can receive otherworldly treatment for wounds, curses, ailments or even alignment issues. (From the reverse meanings of temperance “self-healing” and “re-alignment”) /SleeperOfRlyeh
15. The Devil: Home of the fiends. An aristocracy where it's ruled by 7 rival houses. The more powerful the house, the more they get to (literally) influence the plane and its features. This is because the secret is that everyerson has their own personalized Hell, and many demons themselves are particularly evil (or scorned) souls, or an amalgamation of them. More notable souls here have the biggest and most elaborate personal Hells, with the most demons within them.
16. The Tower:A souped up version of the Quasi-Elemental plane of Dust (2nd edition, Forgotten Realms) A place of wind, sand, and grit, where living creatures decay to dust. You might expect to find ruins in it, but even a ruin would be something and this plane grinds EVERYTHING to nothing, leaving only dust. While on the plane, you take damage constantly as the negative energy of the plane itself tries to tear you apart. It's cold and full of bad luck (you roll everything at a disadvantage while on the plane. /arthurjeremypearson
17. The Star:   The Springs of Hope. The party finds themselves at the edge of a beautiful mountain spring under the beautiful light of a sky full of stars. Bathing in the spring will fill them with a sense of hope and heal all non-magical ailments. They feel no desire to wander away from the spring, but are free to leave the plane whenever they choose. /ClairLestrange
18. The Moon: The Dreamlands. Like the HP Lovecraft setting, and then some. It has a glowing purple moon and a black sun that emits shadow instead of light. There are some theories that is actually the most influenced by other planes, as creatures and structures that symbolize someone or something influential can pop out of nowhere. (For example, a sea-like region can be besieged by a giant robotic kraken, symbolizing an admiral's ambitions to conquer the material plane).
   1.  A dreamlike realm where the boundaries between reality and illusion are blurred. Its atmosphere is surreal and mysterious, filled with shadows that twist and swirl around its rocky terrain. The night sky is filled with stars and a full moon, casting an eerie light over the land. The plane is inhabited by strange creatures, both humanoid and otherworldly, that roam the night. These creatures are often seen in pairs, as if they are on a spiritual journey together. They are often seen as strange reflections of one another, as if they are two sides of the same coin. The plane is also home to a vast network of underground caverns and tunnels. These tunnels are filled with secrets and ancient relics, often guarded by powerful magical beings. Those who brave the tunnels are often rewarded with untold riches and knowledge beyond their wildest dreams. The plane of the Moon is a place of contradictions and mystery. Those who enter it will never be the same again. /NecessaryCornflake7
19. The Sun: A vaporwave-esque city plane. During the day, it's saturated in surreal but relaxing neon and pastel imagery, with music playing that you think you remember from when you were a kid, but you can't quite place. However, when night falls, if you're in the wrong part of town, strange creatures start to emerge, and they glitch, too. (Basically at night it gets analogue horror vibes. Sorry for the buzzwords lol)
20. Judgment: An expanse of flat nothingness, blinding white, littered with strewn rubble and moderately sized boulders. It also has corpses, barely-standing buildings from completely different architectural and cultural sources, a ton of vehicles in various states of decay. There's probably a lot here if you had the time and knowledge to sift through everything. But what's that sound? A whirring engine? Something approaches through the sky! It's as big as a dragon but it glides on fixed wings. And then it unleashes its terrible roar of judgement! Ask not for whom the brrrrrrt tolls, it tolls for you! You wind up on this plane when you're deemed guilty and the A-10 (plane, get it?) is the reaper. With great effort and power you could possibly kill the pilot. Only then will you realize that this plane also holds a fate worse than death as the flight suit begins to wrap itself around your flesh, and the tinted visor colors your world forever smoky gray. /funkyb
21. The World: An expansive an ever stretching realm of doors, portals, windows, which all lead to different destinations, some other planes, some the same plane, denizens here are usually visitors travelling through to other locations, with varying levels of knowledge of the destinations the portals lead to. (From the upright meaning of The World “travel”) /SleeperOfRlyeh"
233,"Darkwood is an overhead survival horror game that takes place In Poland.

234,"##d100 Guild Appearances and Habits

Groups make cities more vibrant and real as people pick alliances and form groups. More highbrow than bandit groups or bland merchant gatherings, guilds may offer services, harass parties, or fight each other. Some are flashy while others are underground, but each has a purpose and a way to indicate who they associate with.  

1. Members of this secretive guild wear leather fox masks painted gold. Rumors abound that the guild members are all kitsune. Is there truth to the rumors, or are they just slippery rogues? This guild deals in gold, secrets, and assassinations. 

2. Members of this guild wear masks that cover the left half of their faces. Members ritually disfigure the left side of their faces once they reach a high enough rank within the group to show their dedication to the cause and so they can recognize each other in public. This guild is in search of ingredients for potions both helpful and sinister in nature. 

3. There exists a guild for exorcists. The members come from all walks of life and wear many types of clothing, but can always be distinguished by a large crystal ball they wear around their necks. They sell services removing ghosts, but whether these services are legit or just silly stories is another matter. 

4. The devotees of the silver lily wear robes of blue and silver, or silver lily pins with blue cut gemstones while undercover. They exist to find lost and new spells, and may offer these to the players... At a price. Members are all exclusively spellcasters, though they'll sell scrolls to anyone. 

5. This group styles themselves as a protection guild, wearing silver and copper armor with the relief of crossed wings. A straightforward guild, they sell protection, offering guards, knights, or escorts through dangerous lands.

6. The Mainroad Investigation and Security Team employ adventurers and able bodied people from all walks of life to help protect travelers along major trade routes and/or backroads. They help with finding missing persons, give directions, and will guide those that are lost to the next closest town. Their members have the option of wearing either a jacket, cloak or robe, pale blue in color. /lt_wolfkill]

7. A professional inquisitors guild that distinguishes themselves with heavy brass rings engraved with the symbol of a rose pierced with needles. The guild is a professional guild for sharing professional tips and tricks, talking shop, and swapping work stories over drinks."
235,"I have been trying to make a big list of cool trinkets I could use in my campaign, anything would be good. Just trying to find more electric type ones. These are some of them that I have so far.(in advance I have been adding these and thank you so much to everyone's help so far)

1. a small, flat device, so old that it's original components are long one, that can be folded open along a long edge. When opened, a Holo of a Mariachi Band appears and plays one very catchy chorus melody until the device is closed again. The device does open all by itself from time to time.
2. a pendant with a digital mirror and some kind of optical scanner. Whomever this pendant is held in front of the face is scanned and the face presented in the mirror changes in some unsettling way
3. a ring made from optical wire and motion powered LEDs. The stronger the g forces experienced, the brighter the rings glow.
4. a set of smart glasses that replaces random faces with the face of a synthetic persona, making faces at the wearer
5. a poncho that changes its color and texture in reaction to the aggressiveness of voices around it.
6. A hologram message detailing how to get to a massive cache of currency but not where the map starts.
7. A simple idea would be data-chips that contain either interesting e-books, or vid/holo/vr programs - some just good stories, others comical, others quite possibly pornographic.
8. A small cobbled together train car that can move on its own using tea or other hot/steaming liquids
9. A [Newton’s cradle]( made of: Holographic chrome spheres. 1. They are expertly rendered but it’s not as satisfying as the real thing. 2. Cybereyes. They blink on impact. It’s possible one still has a functioning wireless camera and it’s used as a surveillance device. 3. Knuckle bones. They aren’t round enough or balanced enough to properly demonstrate the conservation of energy but it’s pretty bad ass. 4. Perfectly round, flawless diamonds the size of marbles. Each would have been worth a fortune a century ago, but diamond manufacturing has become so routine they’re just a novelty toy now. 5. Explosive ammunition rounds. They’ve been disarmed… right?
10. Novelty glasses with attached fake nose and mustache, all plastic. However, they project a photorealistic holographic face over the wearer’s real face which moves with their facial musculature. The battery runs low after 1d6 hours and the lip sync fails first, making it obvious that it’s a disguise.
11. An old unstealable wallet. The electric charge and software fizzled out long ago, so it’s just a wallet.
12. L.e.d brass knuckles. They light up like a disco when you punch someone.
13. A happy birthday card that can be customized to say someone’s name. Some wag customized this one to call you fuckface.
14. A copkiller brass novelty police-style badge. It still plays “fuck da police “ when you press the logo in the center.
15. A graffitti cleaner bot someone tore the wheels off. It’s pissed off and tends to call “disreputable people” things like lumpenproletariat and little Eichmans. It also occasionally shouts “punk is dead”.
16. A food wrapper that's been folded into an origami animal. Roll a d10 to decide the shape. 1: Crane 2: Dog 3: Cat 4: Sheep 5: Horse 6: Fish 7: Bird 8: Mouse 9: Dragon 10: Unicorn
17. A walkie talkie type device which is linked to someone who doesn’t speak the PCs’ languages and just berates them in some foreign tongue
18. A music box made from an asteroid that is exceptionally durable
19. A sealed jar containing a plant that dies of exposed to oxygen.
20. A cooler filled with space lobster eggs. It’s refrigerator is faulty.
21. A key chain to a hover bike that reads “hope rides alone”.
22. An unmarked cube which displays an arrow pointing to a coordinate in space. A number displays distance.
23. A plastic coin with digital displays on both faces. Can be programmed to display whatever the user wants.
24. A kinetic desk toy that changes color each time it changes direction.
25. A solar powered Hula dancing figure. It charges and at night the skirt and bra glow.
26. An old menu to a now closed noodle bar. Still smells like ramen soup.
27. A handheld game device with an attached game cartridge, its label sticker worn off.
28. A usb drive. On it is: 1.Retro games. 2.Malware virus. 3.Encrypted file. 4.Coordinates to hidden cash boxes. 5. A current AAA game, pirated. 6.Poetry on the struggles of gang life.
29. A... cassette tape? Who the hell uses cassettes any more? This could contain some juicy info...
30. A baseball card. The digital portrait swings his bat and strikes a cool pose. You know offhand (DC 10 History check or equivalent) that the guy on the card got merc'd in a drive-by a few years back. That kind of bums you out.
31. A pocket-sized New Testament (or equivalent holy text). It is an ancient and fragile thing, and it stinks of old paper and stale cig smoke. You practically need a magnifier to make out the text.
32.  A heart-shaped locket. When opened, a small digital screen inside depicts the image of a muscle car.
33. A crumpled postcard from someplace sunny and tropical, bearing the phrase *""Wish I Were Here.""* On the back is the address for a strip club written in pen."
236,"The fun little note from Mordenkainen on pg 127 of MToF says: ""Corpse flower seedlings are quite useful for various purposes.""

Any fun ideas for what these uses could be?

Uses for Corpse Flower Seedlings:

1. Use them to replace costly material components in necromancy spells (e.g the pearl in Circle of Death)
2. Use them to make some sort of potion of animate dead
3. Use them to brew a potent poison
4. Extract their stench as a weird perfume
5. Presumably they smell of rotten meat - maybe they can be used as bait in traps"

240,"thought I saw this some place i thought here a wile back.

The adventures find a crude map either etched in a tavern table or ink bleeds on the table. What would be the best way to do this?  Plz add to the list.

1. Two sheets of paper. On the top one draw the map with a felt marker and go over the lines twice in some places, wherever you want more bleed-through. Give the players the bottom copy.

   

2. While relaxing in said tavern a drunkard stumbles around and knocks into the parties table spilling a drink/inkwell in the process. Have the party perform an easy perception check to realise that where the liquid is resting is a relief of a map. Added mystery have the landlord/barman/woman not recognise the table the party is sat at.

   

3. The table carving is a local legend of a treasure hoard stashed away. Many have attempted but none have found it and few have returned whem they realized they valued their life more than a treasure that could not even exist.   

&#x200B;

4. The map is strange scratches in the tabletop, until viewed with a blue tinted mirror or the curve of the metal drinking mug. Love this idea the carving is both reversed and spread out on the table. Could probably do that in Photoshop, mirror and morph.

   

5. Tiny ink ooze that's been trained to form the shape of a map when fed.

&#x200B;

6. All the tables in said tavern have a piece of the map etched into them. Jigsaw type puzzle. 

&#x200B;

7. cracks in the plaster ceiling. Only visible by looking through a glass bottom tankard (see “moon under glass”) however the tavern has changed hands over the years and only has a few glass bottom tankards left. Players would A) have to know where to look and what to look with, a clue from earlier. Or B ) just happen to be lucky enough to look through the glass while looking at the ceiling while finishing off the last of their ale. 

&#x200B;

8. he tavern happens to be full this night. Your party insists on a table so the barkeep and the cook carry out a very old dusty table with one short leg. Mugs keep falling over so one of the party members ducks down to fix it when they notice a detailed craving of an incomplete  map.

   

9. The map is on the floor of the tavern, the entire floor. It is actually the pattern in the wood and it is only visible for a short time (ten minutes or so) when they mop. The owner says it’s been that way for as long as he can remember and he grew up there, family  business. He never thought anything about it.

&#x200B;

10. Feeling along the edge of the table there's a rough seam. A good smack and a false panel opens, revealing a rolled map.

&#x200B;

11. Something I used too do..I'd make 2 maps. I'd stash the original in my notes. Then I would take the copy, beat it up, sun bake, burn bits, water log, & write in unkown symbols. Sometimes break it in too pieces.

a. I used to do this, using carefully taped on pieces of paper to add and subtract things, then making a copy of that updated for the party.

&#x200B;

12. Have it on the bottom of a table or stool that gets flipped over during the fight. When the fight is over have the bartender ask the party to help him clean the place up. Have the players make perception checks. Highest one is the player that goes to put the stool back in place and notices the extremely faded map.

&#x200B;

13. Hmmm...considering how many potential people have seen the map as seen carved into a table so beer spills would also reveal it. This would not be a secret map. Why not have it lead to ""Uncle Bob's Explorer's Emporium."" It is an advertisement placed to draw customers to its out of the way location. If you were looking for it to be ""secret"", then have the table be in a secret room or in an out of the way location (private office). I like the concept - has a ""National Treasure"" vibe to it. 

&#x200B;

14. It's the shape of a map but its actually several variations on exploding runes. Roll saving throw to be hypnotized by it. As they look longer and longer it begins to morph and change angle. All of the sudden the look around. They are in the map. CUE ""Take on Me"" by (Name Here)

&#x200B;

15. Have them spill a strong liquor. Maybe a bit of a fire ensues. They put it out and wipe down the table, voila, ancient map reveal as it no longer has crud in it."

My players will soon investigate an abandoned dwarven citadel orbiting the planet. What sort of rooms are there, and what do they contain?

Some examples:

1. Main landing pad: A balcony-style landing pad featuring an entrance into the citadel carved in the shape of an enormous gaping maw. Perhaps there are constructs or golems guarding the entrance.
2. Throne room for the clan leader. Contains an ornate iron throne wrought with scenes of dwarven industry. The room has an upper gallery for audiences to view the room.
3. The Forge. Contains the spelljamming forge.
4. Kitchens. At least three large kitchens located on different floors, with pantries, cold rooms, sculleries, large ovens, etc.
5. Armories. One to three armories located on different floors. Perhaps the larger armories store mundane weapons, while a smaller armory contains magic weapons. Such an armory might be hidden in a secret passage or guarded by traps.
6. Datalith Storage - Floating polished stones shimmer with iridescence. Close examination reveals they are engraved with microscopic historical and technological records.
7. Brewery - barrels and equipment missing parts
8. Distillery
9. Feast Hall
10. The Vault. An elaborate, giant, solid mithral vault door engraved with various dwarven glyphs and sigils stands between the Throne Room and this glorious treasury. Protected by arcane barriers as well as elaborate locks of mechanical masterwork, the impenetrable vault door guards a safehouse of platinum, jewels, and magical artifacts, totaling an amount of money nearly incomprehensible to the normal citizen. It appears untouched, still holding the treasures of the dwarven empire, still protecting the hoard of wealth.
11. Crematorium
12. Crop fields. Perhaps the ceilings are enchanted to go through day/night cycles. Perhaps contains the remains of various plants or fungi used by the dwarves for (bio-luminescence, crafting materials, drink, food, medicine, spices, textiles, tobacco, etc). May still be a few viable surviving specimens.

38. Astrological navigation room. A domed ceiling covered in tiny flecks of light, mimicking the night sky, could be used to train astral navigation or prepare scouts/runners by teaching them the location of the stars of their location. (maybe the dome is magic and the location of stars can be swapped around, or it could be done manually/via a mechanism by shuffling around the tiny bricks that form the ceiling)
39. Tomb Hall. A hallway full of pillars, each pillar containing the upright sarcophagus of dead dwarves, stacked according to some dwarven cultural schema. (class? clan? hierarchy? age? merit?)

244,"Been reading a lot of China Mieville lately and I'd like to fill out the kitchen sink fantasy world I'm building some more. My one ""rule"" is that if something is \[flora/fauna\]folk, I'd appreciate a cultural detail or ability to make them more interesting. Thank you! Otherwise, entries can be as detailed as you like, you don't even have to name them if you don't want!

1. The Macabrula: Humanoids with spider heads and 6-8 legs extending from their backs. Some have bony exoskeletons, some have black hair and red eyes, and some even have translucent skin.
2. Ghuls: A small mechant race covered head to toe in rags and cloaks, with glowing pinprick eyes. They peddle their wares in exchange for a little bit of blood or a piece of your soul, if you don't have money.
3. Vesuviyeti: Hairy, horned humanoids like the yeti of legend. But they also have colored stripes that make them immune to heat or cold, and giving them a breath weapon.
4. Tiny fish people that pilot mechs to walk
5. Golemori:  Part undead, part machine. A mysterious black liquid pumps in them instead of blood.
6. Grimalkin: Catfolk with a special connection to the dark arts.
7. A race of doll-like mannequins that hold the souls of trapped aberrations. They're amnesiacs. For now.
8. Lunarians: Look like tieflings, but white and yellow (and sometimes red and blue) and have horns that resemble different moon phases. They came from the moon (which may or may not be fake) to get money out of running cults they don't even believe in.
9. Namelys - A small charming race that assists travelers on journeys. They are well meaning but rambunctious to say the least. They like asking travelers “Can I have your name?” And old Fae trick to be sure. But those who are not aware get their names taken and find themselves unable to say their name. the only way to get it back is to find it written on a piece of bark from the Namely’s “Name Tree” and tear it off. usually the tree very easy to find, usually in well traveled areas so that other travelers may laugh at those who fell for it while they look for their name on the tree. The higher up on the tree the more the Namely didn’t like you.  /LordSwitchblade
10. Illwishlings: Half-Genies who thanks to their magic are the sole surviving parts of humans abducted and enslaved by Drow. Faced with slavery and hardship, they fell to darkness. Now their genie parts are Jinni natured, their fulfilling of wishes the act of mercenaries and assassins and their magic a curse upon all who ask anything of them, ever. /Ytumith
11. Glasfingers: Brain-shaped slugpeople who emit a glass-like substance as their shell. Their exosceleton is translucent and their fingertips are very very pointy. They are quite smart and train mages within their ranks. /Ytumith
12. Deeplings - Unlike their hillock and warren-dwelling cousins, the halflings, Deeplings never really stopped tunneling. Deeplings have adapted to the challenges of life in the furthest depths. Their dark skin gives them great stealth in their massively complex networks of small round tunnels, and their jet-black irises and gold flecked luminous pupils allow them to see clearly in all but the most absolute darkness. Additionally, they are more sinewy in comparison to their stoutly built kin, but their wiry frames hide uncommon durability. /TMKF2
13. Minotaurs: Actually pretty friendly, overrepresented as stevedores for obvious reasons of brute strength. Hit a lot of tropes and stereotypes for the obvious reason: A wizard did it, and they knew the tropes and stereotypes when they started planning the creation of the minotaurs. Twist: A wizard did it, once upon a time. Now, quite a few wizards will do it, but you'll need to pick out a cow first, since they're made Fullmetal Alchemist style. Transmutation specialists recommend small horns (door frames are going to be enough of a challenge already…) and small udders (they don't make cow-bras yet!) and if you pick out a steer instead of a bull, the effects are predictable. Some people actually want that, though, so not every wizard will warn you first. As a result, there's a constant supply of people who are shocked to discover that they just neutered themselves unintentionally, much to the great amusement of those who didn't. Actually kinda popular, in spite of stigma, stereotypes, and lifestyle complications. /Chrontius
14. Tragians - Plant folk that look like a knot of pulsating gristle at the center of a tumbleweed-like knot of thorny exoskeleton. They grow from seeds, rooted in a single place until reaching adolescence, when they break off from their roots and roll out into the world to seek their fortune. Since moving to the city, many have become involved in the surprisingly violent underground street racing scene.  /SurfeitOfPenguins
15. Children of Gilvalg - Hundreds of years ago, the wizard Gilvalg built a magical device to create servants for their tower, but just as they were switching it on, they were struck by lightning, killing them instantly. The device has run continuously ever since. Every night at midnight, the device spawns a new Child, built from a random assortment of animal parts, no two ever the same save for the wizard's sigil somewhere on their skin. Children live, on average, three to six lunar cycles before magical instability tears them apart, but all of the Children share a unified consciousness, which gives them memories that extend back to the previous age. The Children have built up a small settlement around the base of Gilvalg's tower, tending to their orchards and offering sanctuary to all who are feared and misunderstood. /SurfeitOfPenguins
16. Prismatids - humanoid folk who appear to have forms made from smoky liquid crystal. They cannot speak, but many have learned to display Common text on their foreheads. They eat color, sucking it out of the world around them, leaving their surroundings drab and desaturated. This makes them unpopular in most settlements. They do, however, make for very cheap labor, since you can pay them in flowers or any old rubbish, as long as it's colorful. /SurfeitOfPenguins
17. A species of slime that is intensely democratic. Whenever a slime is conflicted about anything, it splits itself into two or more parts, each part representing a perspective on the problem. The parts then discuss their points of view in their own language, which involves firing complex bursts of pheromones at one another, toxic to most other species. Once reaching consensus, the slimes re-merge, although there are cases of unresolvable problems becoming bitter feuds lasting decades, or until one side of the issue was wiped out by the other. /SurfeitOfPenguins
18. Fingos: A human variant with one finger per hand. You'd be surprised how much culture changes when you've got two fingers total instead of ten. Half-Fingos tend to be born with opposable thumbs. /-Brigand-
19. Madlings are small fey humanoids (gnome, sprite, faeries, dryads, pixies) that have been made into thralls for an Illithid colony. They appear as ragged and emaciated versions of their primary race, with one additional horrific feature: The tops of their skulls are missing altogether from where the insidious saliva of the Illithids has polluted their minds. Mindless and wild from the Illithids' toxin, their only remaining motivations are chaos, destruction, and survival. They travel in bands, recklessly attacking and devouring whatever living things they encounter, and destroying with wild abandon anything they can set their claws into. /TMKF2
20. Waeflings are lithe fey creatures akin to pixies and sprites, native to underground environments. They appear as small, naked, pale gray humanoids with supernaturally wispy bodies, limbs, and fingers. While it’s unknown if by fey magic or simply due to their slender nature, Waeflings travel freely in extensive networks of cracks and crevasses of the mountains. Waeflings are unpredictable and ill-tempered and hold a high value on obscure rules of courtesy and etiquette that they seem to communicate poorly and change frequently. Among the other underdark races, the Waefling is seen as an omen of calamity, and the longer a Waefling stays around, the more likely that disaster is imminent. Occasionally a Waefling can be bribed with gifts of food, fermented beverages, spell components, or precious metals or stones. /TMKF2
21. Mökkurkálfi (Mistcalfa): Like the war-forged and some golems, the Mökkurkálfi (automatons made of clay, dirt, and mud) were made for war and to wage a war of battles long forgotten. It is easy to mistake a Mistcalfa as just another golem if it was not for their personalities and emotions. Their faces morph to what they think would best serve them and morph their body to suit. They get clean by dusting themselves with dry earth and giving just enough water to keep them from becoming statues. Once washed away or shattered as a statue, the mistcalfa is no more. /TMKF2
22. The Forgelings: Of ash and soot are forgelings born. They are given life by some unknow force but, seem to be tied to some other plane of existence. They are set to some small humanoid form and do not age. They eat fire and embers as that helps them cling to the life they were cursed or blessed with. Skilled in cooking, forging, alchemy, or any craft that is aided by the fire, the forgelings work hard and enjoy a job well done despite their faceless appearances and emotionless voices. Some wear masks to better articulate their feelings. /TMKF2
23. Lupin: (A good adaption of the throw back race of Lupins) \[i dont know how to hyperlink this in such a long post. for other readers just scroll down to his comment\] Not much is known to outsiders of the mysterious lupin people. Built like humans with the head of a dog, many creatures mistake lupins for gnolls or werewolves from a distance. Despite their appearance, they hold only malice and distain for werewolves and gnoll.  /Th3R3493r
24. The Tool Spirits (tsukumogami): A treasured tool which gains consciousness and a spirit which allows them to move, talk, and fight. Most will stick to what they know from what they were used or witnessed as a tool and hold a personality similar to the ones who used and maintained it pre-awakening. Many guilds value a tsukumogami as a master craftsman and will move mountains to get one under their employ.  /Th3R3493r
25. The Nummumen (Coin People): Coins are everywhere whether they are treasure, lost, spent, stolen, or freshly minted, most see money as just an object or a means to an end. To the Nummumen, Coins is their blood, body, soul, and culture. No one knows what animates them not even themselves. They are not magical yet they move like whatever form they fancy. The Nummumen are composed of coins and vary in size and shape depending on the size of their coffer or body or whatever they view themselves as. They are distrustful of anything that only eyes them as coin, but, understand they are composed of it. In the chest of every Nummumen is an ancient minted heart-coin of unknowable origin and material. If this coin is separated from the rest of its mass, the other coins are returned to being just coins. If the coin is completely destroyed, the Nummumen dies, but, a damage heart coin can be repaired with the right skills. Only the sharing a sliver of many nummumen heart coins can mint a new nummumen heart, this is rare. /Th3R3493r
26. The Blanks: A race of blank faced, verbally mute, near identical, pale white, genderless mannequins. Each has a different personality and can communicate telepathically with anyone in their native tongue but, they can not hear the person's thoughts or read their mind. They physically can do whatever is in the realm of a fledgling sorcerer or sorceress can and has a grasp on the cantrips of prestidigitation, thaumaturgy, and disguise self. They make wonderful actors but, they recharge in their true form for three hours a day or they will start to just become a regular mannequin.  /Th3R3493r
27. Novas: A race of faintly glowing, multihued humanoids. Groups of them have been found living- if their existence can be classified as living- in all sorts of places and civilizations. Tribal villages in the deepest jungles, spacefaring colonies, even just plain old towns. They are composed of a thick and rubbery skin formed around any of a number of gases and chemicals. A curious Nova may accidentally harm a human, thinking they function the same way.  (They kinda look like colorful ghosts) /Wabutan
28. Slugh’ekh, Corpse-slurpies, The slurpies. Alien, ghoulish creatures with four hand-like extremities, grey to light-pink skin complexion, thick long hair covering the outer side of their knees, elbows and head, a round mouth like a vortex filled with numerous salivating tongues slithering in and out. Their huge misty eyes offer them a bad vision to total blindness, so they depend on tasting the air for navigation. They appear at night, feasting on fresh corpses of any creature. They will suck out the bile, mucus and bone marrow but ignore everything else and leave. Nobody knows how or why, where they came from, what they want, or where they go afterward. They seem harmless to living creatures and they will scuttle off if anything will approach them. Cemeteries are one of their favourite places, a feeding ground but only when no one's around. /admiralhayreddin
29. Ûlsirs (in dwarven), Wintersouls, Snow Mist Spectres The legend talks about a soul that perished in the middle of the unforgiving mountains under the whims of a powerful snow storm. The creature was rushing to get back home, back to its beloved, for a reason forever lost, forever forgotten. There was nothing and nobody that could stop it getting back. Such was its determination that even Death that took its body could not stop the spirit from moving forward. The poor soul would not let it be. It took the form of wind and snow and rushed to his beloved only to realize… that it was betrayed. Now it roams purposelessly the winter realms, a malignant trickster driven by whims. It tricks travellers into danger, hazards and misfortune. Unfortunate events occur to by-passers when it is around, and the poor souls that do not escape death lured by it, are turning into one. Lately the numbers of those spirit creatures have grown. They are very elusive, tricky and hard to destroy. Witches talk about the Prime, the first one. And how the only way for the plague to be dispelled is to confront the Prima Mors. The first-death. /admiralhayreddin

248,"I am creating a water world with some magic and steam-punkish vibes, inspired by 20,000 leagues under the sea and the world of D&D.

5. A species of sloth exists on a jungle planet who’s bodies are home to a glowing fungus with immense medical importance. Be careful, though, they aren’t the only things there.
6. There is a small pond that contains the last snail of it's kind, and a fish that's the last of it's kind. They are both pregnant. The current {insert fake-science} levels are slowly killing both of them, and they'll die before they give birth. If you raise the {insert fake-science} level with {MacGuffin X} the snail dies, but the fish will live. If you lower the levels using {MacGuffin Y}, the reverse is true. Neither can live anywhere but this pond because of {more fake science}. [From]

[From]

8. Somebody needs to install some custom surveillance cameras in a lair of a very irritable dragon-like creature. The creature is very territorial but mostly by electrovision - no electronics are permitted in the lair or in the n-mile radius around it (the cameras are biological and the scientists can loan some low-level analog armor and weapons for self-defence). [From]

9. An invasive species was introduced to a new ecosystem and it already caused a couple native species to go extinct due to competition and predation. The issue is that another native species used to only eat the extinct creatures and has now adapted to only eat the invasive one, but not in enough quantities to keep things balanced. Do you exterminate the invasive species, certainly dooming their predators, or do you allow the invasive species to remain, potentially, but not certainly, dooming many other species? [From]

10. Humans or comparable beings settle a newly discovered heavily forested planet only to find a small, sentient species living there as well. This species closely guards information about themselves and their environment, but aren't unfriendly, just alien. They often ask head-scratching questions about the colonists and the ""Great Trees"" of their own world, while giving confused looks to the new arrivals when asked basic questions about their life or society The person with the best rapport  with these odd little creatures goes into the woods under mysterious circumstances and is found a few days later dead. His body is carved open and from his chest is growing a newly planted sapling. When asked about the man's death, the sentient creatures seem puzzled by the concept and try and stop the humans when they take him away for proper burial. What is the nature of this strange species and can you find a way to keep the new species and humanity from devolving into all out bloodshed? [From]

11. The Xenowarden's call the PC's to a remote area to investigate the fossilize remains of a common predator that has extensive cybernetic implants and weapons.

250,"I’ve got my players attacking a cursed candy factory and need some terrible candy monster puns. Silly but horrifying is the theme. There should be a macabre twist to an otherwise goofy monster. These things may be silly, but they are a serious threat.
Also puns in foreign languages or referencing obscure candy brands are encouraged.  If you can come up with a workable Wasabi Kit Cat more power to you

1. Black pudding- it’s literally a black pudding made out of black pudding. It lacks the acid attack but is now tougher thanks to thicker skin, since blood is thicker than water.

2. Gummi owlbear- an owlbear made of sugary gelatin. It kills by smothering because its claws and beak no longer can hurt people. 

3. Gingerdead men- zombies made out of gingerbread. Easy to kill but they just keep pouring out of the oven and are still painfully warm. A reference to a terrible Gary Busey film. 


4. Jawbreaker trolls 
Trolls made out of jawbreaker. Not as tough as regular trolls but can still pack a wallop, and yes a punch from them will break your jaw.

5. Bearded Dragon
A large Chinese dragon with a magnificent beard, scales made of marzipan and mint, peen tong claws, and boiling orange jelly as a breath attack. The claws can shatter, infect wounds, and kill you if you’ve got a severe nut allergy or severe untreated diabetes. Otherwise it will just increase your blood sugar significantly. This exists because there’s a traditional chinese form of cotton candy called Dragon’s beard. 

6. Giant candy lobster.
A giant carnivorous lobster made out of candy. A hard outer shell conceals a nut-butter filling. A lame pun on a Russian candy brand.


7. Jungle Howler – Licorice monkey that moves and attacks in packs, and pose a double danger because of their high pitched, loud screams and second because they are really salty. They can speak but all they say is vicious mockery, requiring a wisdom save.  Named for a popular Swedish candy. /myeviltwin47)

8. Chocolich - Personal favourite pun of mine and one I've used for Valentine's Day several times. A lich that's hell-bent on raising the dead as chocolate minions. /Aquille5310)

251,"I want to make a list a weird/wacky alien bounty hunters for my characters to face of against. Leave ideas in the comments 

1. Gubber: She comes from a species dwelling beneath the surface of sticky marshes.  Bubbles burble continually from her blowhole.  Generally they're innocuous, but when desired she can excrete an enzyme into her mucous glands that turns the bubbles into floating blobs of adhesive.

2. Big Pokey: A porcupine-like biped whose spikes stick in her foes.

3. Spitfire: Like an anglerfish, he spits with great range and accuracy.  Unlike an anglerfish, the spittle is incendiary.

4. Flats Domino: This dark creature with two white spots for eyes is so thin as to be nearly two-dimensional.  Slips easily through cracks.  With the edge of its hands like razor blades, its karate chops are deadly.

5. The Hugboxer: A master martial artist whose ultimate attack is to pull her victim into a bone-crushing hug, while cooing soothingly.

6. Inflatermaus: A rodent-like creature that can puff itself up from an internal hydrogen gland, becoming lighter than air.

7. Ma and Pa Gomerin:  an old couple who are retired military but look like completely harmless old people doddering around.  However they are considered one of the best bounty hunting teams out there.
R.E.D.  Retired, Extremely Dangerous  is how they are classified in Ultra top secret Documents that have been HEAVILY redacted!

8. Killbot 300 Mark VI - a robot that hates living creatures. It takes jobs for extremely low rates not only because it enjoys killing, but because it enjoys undercutting its humanoid competitors.

9. Slim McGillicuddy - the ghost of a long-dead bounty hunter. Even in death he continues to stalk his prey. He can’t affect the living but he can track them down and report on their whereabouts, should anyone in the vicinity be holding a seance.

10. Allison Huntsman — beautiful, bold, and relentless. Poses as a bimbo… but she’s anything but. 

11.	⁠Ma Cleetus, and Tha' Boyz: They'z orks whuts r' space cannibals whoze eatz only whatz they killz! They'mz love it whenz da' bounty fightz back! Ma Cletus carries her kettle everywhere, which is made from the turret of an old tank she destroyed back in the war.

12.	⁠Rollerskates, and rockets, and surplus anti-tank-guided munitions.  No one ever said they had to be GOOD bounty hunters, or effective.

13.	⁠The Pacifsits. They're actually part of a gestalt being which colonizes sapient bodies with sentient couch-potato fat-cell jelly blobs of protomolecule.  They'll catch their prey, eventually, they just need to catch their breath a bit, maybe release some airborne fungal fruiting bodies.  They are somehow experts at capturing fleeing craft, provided they can land some spores on it, and for there to be sufficient biomass, or in a pinch, some organic material to convert.  They hunt bounties to be able to afford the media subscription fees for entertainment media to watch.

14.	⁠The Aleph Squad.  Legally distinct from the A-Team.

15. Killer Comet: Their ship was made to resemble a comet for their unsuspecting victims. Little is known what they look like. Think twice when you see a passing comet!

16. The Sale's Pitch: Dressed as space salesman they have something to sell you that you probably don't want at the convenience of your own ship, a swift death! No soliciting has a whole new meaning to life.

17. The Ship dock: Ship dock workers who angrily gave up their low paying job for a more exciting career of bounty hunting. They covertly pose as typical ship dock workers to only catch you and your ship in a deadly trap. No, that is not where I want to park my shuttle by this highly radioactive cargo container!

18. Cardiac Arrest: These Rogue Medical Professions know too well how the heart(s) works in any humanoid or alien lifeform and use diabolical means to stop your heart from working when you would least expect! Cause of death: Old age or Heart Attack. 

19. The Collective:  Bounty hunting is actually a side effect.  There are actually collecting entire planets of people and forcing to become part of the Collective.  However a part of them has realized that some of the sentients they collect are wanted and they release them to their fate.  however this is really a ploy to find the prison planets so they can be added to the Collective.
i.e. they are like the borg.  you will join the Collective or die! 

20. RV-N8, ""Ravenna""
One of ten prototype Reaver class assault droids manufactured by Sorotek industries, a defense contractor.
The Reaver class was quickly deemed unsuitable for use in the field due to the AI core developing an individual personality too quickly and being prone to insubordination.
RV-N8 managed to escape the recalls and has gone without proper maintenance since then, including regular memory wipes.
RV-N8 has since decided that she is a person and goes by the name Ravenna. She does everything in her power to present as a person, including wearing clothes and a wig. She even has acquired a reprogrammable Thespian mask to express emotion. When she is on the job, it is always set to happy.
The longer she goes without a memory wipe, the more her AI core learns and turns her into the most efficient killing machine in the galaxy. And the more unstable she becomes. Will her AI core make her develop a conscious as she becomes closer to being a human, or will the overwhelming force of her base code to kill drive her insane?

Now give it the personality of a puppydog, concern for the general welfare, undying loyalty to the Old Ragnorak constitution, and all the malice of a rose petal. That’s an Old Ragnorak Dog of War. The Dogs of war were retired following the peace treaty between Yawning Gap and Old Ragnorak signed by Old Ragnorak President Tenebrous Brink and Yawning Gap Council Head Sky Daddy.

43. Melvin- incompetent, short and can talk to dead people. His armor looks intimidating until you notice all the bullet holes that killed the last guy to wear it. 

44. The Sovereign Nation of Gule:
At about 1cm in height, the average Gulian warrior is not very threatening, which is why the Gulian royal family commissioned the construction of the transforming battlecruiser ‘Super Gule Fortress One’! A truly colossal 3m long warship capable of rapidly transforming into a humanoid robot and engaging an average sized galactic citizen in hand-to-hand combat!

46. Bad Penny: She claims she's just lucky, she guesses, and it's not her fault all those bad things happen to her bounties after she brings them in; they were alive and well when they got there! Rumor has it she steals the luck of her prey; they don't need it where they're going.

47. Final Destination: Always takes commercial transport; trained and certified as commercial pilot on a number of large civilian transport modalities. Only takes lethal jobs or ones in which the bounty is not required to be alive at the end. AI analysis of thier record notes thier presence at a 4-Sigma greater number of incidents involving civilian fatalities than normal, but all events involve only one or no more than a handful of fatalities, never mass casualty events, and never involving a transport the hunter personally rode on.

48. Hotte Ronda and Her H.O.G.G.: Highly Agressive Sukeban with her Own Licensed Anime Series.  This duo consists of a ""Biker"" and her transforming robotic air-speeder combat-unit exosuit combo.  Extreme mobility, and lethal weaponry loadout.  The torturous abbreviation of her robot vehicle armor sidekick remains unexplained and undefined, even in her Anime, a fact that leaves many of her fans speculating as to its possible meanings. 

49. The Bukkit Clan: What happens when a clan of Jawas decide to give up the ol' junk dealer route, and instead start to target bounties?  You get the Bukkit clan; they converted thier sand crawler for spaceflight, and added some Universal Assembler components to turn it into a walking factory they use to bodge together every manner of second hand crazed killer droid you can think of, and then control them against thier targets.

50. The Ghost: As in, the Ghost in the Machine, a powerfully skilled hacker who has gained a reputation across all of Meat-space, Hyper-space, and (yes, even) Cyber-space, able to subborn and overridr just about any machine or device, ships included, and turn them into a member of thier bounty-hunting borg collective.  Theyre suprisingly adept at avoiding collateral damage too, going so far as to patch and upgrade any devices they hack (that survive the assault and arent bricked, anyway) for security holes. 

51. Narcissoi: Bounty Hunting is a Side Hustle for this androgenous paragon of consumer beauty and fetishistic fascism; their regular segments in HYPERFASHION, SPACEFACE, and their own holo-channel FASTFASHFASCFACTSFAX more than provide a stream of revenue to make even Croesus blush -- no, they love the uniform, darling, and crushing ill-clothed ANTS beneath one's feet is positively exhilarating, and when one has an army of loyal fans as an intelligence network, why not leverage it?

52. Mirror and rorriM: This charmingly sadistic pair of mutant psychic twins are both quite vain, and have the unique ability to enter and travel through reflective surfaces; the larger, shiner, and less distorted the better, likening it to pushing through water or jelly or even more viscous material depending on various qualities. One quirk, they never are both on the side of the mirror facing the viewer, but occasionally are both seen in the mirror with nothing on our side. Imperial Researchers salivate, and hope one day for these clever twins to screw up enough to be convicted and sentenced to be vivisection research subjects, but so far, despite their vanity, they have yet to be caught committing any offense warranting such a punishment.

53. The Carson Crew: '♩ Here's a Story of a Bounty Hunteress who was hunting with three very skillful girls, all of them were talented martial artists, the youngest one in curls. ♫ ... yadda yadda da da da dada... ♪ That's the way they all became the Carson Crew!!! ♩♬'

54. Holo-sitcom Family Turned Bounty Hunters: The entire sitcom family have become bounty hunters.  They are really rogue-androids who all have adopted the personas of the fictional family and somehow, in thier shared-delusion, have decided that capturing bounties is all part of a very special episode.  They tend to become ultra-violent when something contradicts this world-view.

55. Marsha Marsha Marsha: She was once a teenage actress on a popular holo-sitcom.  Then she got mutant superpowers and became a ruthless bounty hunter.  She can duplicate herself, but it takes about ten minutes each time, with the duplicate being indistinguishable and neither able to recall which is the copy.  They all answer to Marsha.  None of them are sure who is actually the original, or if the original is even still alive.

56. Little Johnny:  Once a patient at an experimental psychiatric treatment institute, Little Johnny came under the delusion that he was part of a beloved holo-sitcom family. Johnny's psychic powers quickly evolved to the point that he is able to manifest the cast of the show and insert himself in as a main character.  Due to budget cuts, the mutant was released and his file marked ""Not Dangerous"".  Thankfully, the generally upbeat nature of the show means Johnny sees his role as a figure of Law and Order, upholding Justice for the downtrodden by turning every Bounty into a very special episode.  Fatalities and Rescidivism rates from Johnny's Bounties are statistically lower than average, meaning Johnny's Message may actually have an lasting impact..."
252,"The climaxes for most adventures most often come down to a big combat scene (either players vs villain, or multi-character war). When you end your adventures with big battles every time, it becomes a bit predictable and repetitive. 

If I look through the list of action/adventure movies for inspiration, it seems like most of them end on a typical combat scenes as well. Nothing is wrong with that, but I'm struggling to think of good non-combat climaxes.

I'd like you guys to help me brainstorm a list of possible climaxes for an adventure that are not just a big battle.

What I mean by ""climax"" is the final challenge/encounter that resolves the story. A cool, exciting, dramatic, memorable ending to an adventure. An epic scene, often at a cool location, where the heroes overcome a high stakes challenge, take action, accomplish some difficult objective that resolves the story.

Have you played adventures with different kinds of interesting climax scenes? Or read stories, or seen movies, with different types of climaxes that would work well in an adventure?

Here's what I can think of so far:

1. Chase scene.
2. Big public event.
3. Race to the goal.
4. Rescue and escape.
5. Natural disaster, cataclysm.
6. Destroying a location or an item.
7. Overcoming a big environmental obstacle.
8. Dangerous situation (""hanging by your fingertips off a cliff"")
9. Reaching a hard to reach place (like climbing a building or a mountain, diving into the depths of the ocean, etc).
10. Heist, successfully committing a crime and escaping."
253,"Hello! I need help brainstorming some ideas for one aspect of my D&D realm known as the Isles of Etherwolfe.

Due to a worldbuilding secret I shall not share, spectral ‘Echoes’ from past worlds have a chance of slipping through the cracks, appearing as cryptic ethereal images that often have no connection to the world. They are simply remnants of previous worlds, other civilizations, “alien” species like strange other version of elves, etc. These Echoes could even be specific references from your world or other D&D worlds, anything! Make them strange, make them mysterious, make them unexplained, and let’s create a cool list of ideas!

**Echoes from the Past:**

Note: Most, if not all of these Echoes should appear Spectral, as if being seen on the Ethereal Plane.

d100. Echo
1. A cathedral dedicated to an unknown deity (flower symbol) inhabited by strange elves.
2. A small river flowing north, which suddenly turns upward and floats into the air and disappears
3. A war-torn battlefield strewn with rusted armor and weapons, still-flaming arrows scatter the ground
4. Ruins of a cyclopean city emerging from a shifting river-bank.  Bodies of petrified giants trapped in poses from everyday life.
5. A mana-dense vault filled with thousands of crystalline discs six inches across that shine with a reflective rainbow in the light.
6. The ruins of a greek-style bank run by a collection of metallic-skinned halflings.
7. Various flapping banners staked into the ground representing the different elements.
8. A row of hundreds of humanoid statues. In fact, they are the same statue expressed over hundreds of years. The ones in the front are broken and weathered, the ones in the middle gleam with paint and polish, and the final ones are uncarved plinths of stone.
9. A stone building can be seen in different eras depending what side you view it from. Entering from the basement entrance allows PCs to interact with a disoriented shopkeeper.
10. The upper slope of this area displays many tilting grave markers. Where the land has eroded, spectral skeletons float as if in repose, their spectral headstones floating six feet above.
11. A lone sailing ship, lilting to the side. The ropes and wheel still gently move despite the lack of any crew.
12. A massive, thick wall of trees standing in a circle. Inside of the circle is a clearing where snow gently falls around an old cabin.
13. A colossal warforged titan stands atop a hill, its sadness palpable. It slams its fists down on a column of soldiers, the ground trembling from the force. More soldiers advance, siege weapons primed to fire.
14. A flying ship with a ring of fire descends over an elegant Victorian city, full of twinkling lights.
15. A lightning rail stops at a station in a small wilderness town, its energy connecting to the conductor stones in the ground.
16. On another hill, shrouded in fog, a dilapidated one-story cabin emits a beam of blue light, summoning zombies and skeletons clothed in ruined soldier equipment begin to emerge from the fog.
17. An echo of a community endlessly replays one hour of mundane village life. The village met some terrible end, and when PCs move close to persons, objects, or buildings, the echo temporarily dissolves to show the current state of the place, which is ugly and sad.
18. The father guided his son, teaching him how to properly aim and bend the bowstring. In the lush forest, a deer suddenly appeared in the clearing. Whispering instructions, the father watched as the boy released the arrow.
19. The mother watched unamused as her children fought over a toy in the front yard of the tree house. She abruptly stopped the fight by taking away the toy and instructed them on how to treat each other better. The scolding brought tears of sorrow to the children, but the mother was quick to comfort them with a hug and kisses, reassuring them of her love.
20. A grandpa and their granddaughter ventured deep into the magical forest together to collect wild berries. As they wandered, grandpa spotted something dangerous lurking in the shadows. He quickly drew his granddaughter closer and shielded them with his magical staff, ready to protect her from the unseen danger.
21. An exhausted salaryman walking from the glass box of their office to their old Geo Metro, while above them looms a planet, of awesome size, lit by no sun. A dark titan, all thick black forests and jagged mountains and deep turbulent oceans.
22. Impossibly tall metal towers made of impossibly slender sticks, while lonely red light pulses slowly at it's top.  Disturbing black birds hunch menacingly, roosting upon it in great numbers.  Hallucinatory, ethereal music in no recognizable style seems to buzz within one's teeth as they draw near to the apparition.
23. A strangely dressed man sitting behind a desk while a confusing array of boxers and esoteric instruments sit before him. He talks in an unknown language, fiddles with one of the instruments, placing a black disc upon a sort of spinning table, and suddenly from no discernable location, alien music can be heard.
24. A hard sort of road but made of a sort of greyish black stone that seems poured like a river, it is very wide, and seems to go in both directions forever.  Several lines of strange metal boxes, somewhat like carriages, go in both directions, countless in number, rolling slowly, occasionally stopping then starting again in waves, making no noise, and with no-one inside.
25. A vast canyon, with seemingly infinitely tall towers made of glass on both sides.  Every floor of the tower seems to be comfortably furnished in (admittedly alien design), but also appears to have at least one terrified person silently banging on the glass, apparently begging to be let out.  Occasionally it rains bodies, they fall from great height from above, then through the ground as if it isn't there, and keep going.
26. A person in a strange sort of greyish-white diving suit with a large, bulky looking backpack contraption on their back, wielding a striped flag, and bouncing around as if they were almost floating.
27. A giant airship zeppelin, coming in to dock at a tall tower. A large crew of people on the ground pull on lines connected to the ship, pulling it in to dock.
28. A large beast-man with horns and cloven feet, wearing a long coat and a strange set of mirrored lenses upon their face, scowls, crosses their arms and pantomimes, seeming to deny you entry.
29. A labyrinthine maze with walls higher than a person, extends to the horizon.
30. A friendly red dog, the size of a large house, with fangs the size of a grown person, and a mouth that could swallow you in one go. It wants to play.
31. A school of ornamental goldfish, each the size of a blue-whale, just swimming as if the air were water.
32. a ruined and partially collapsed castle, structured using large brass pipes; once a center of learning and discovery for steam powered technology
33. A caveman sizes up a lightning-struck, burning log, pokes it, and runs away howling in pain.
34. A little girl points toward the entrance of a dark forest, as the unsuspecting farmers walk hesitantly within. Smiling deviously, the girl stays a distance back. Suddenly, large red, illuminated eyes appear from the forest darkness, causing the farmers to scream in terror.
35. A priest, a nobleman, and a guard pass by an old beggar on the street without offering help, but a mixed adventuring party of a tiefling, halfling, dragonborn, and humans stop to give the beggar assistance. In gratitude, the beggar hugs one of them.
36. An exhausted alchemist conducts a complicated experiment with various colored liquids, beakers, and pipes. Upon the completion of the experiment, the gnome jumps with joy, holding the main vial as if it were a new precious child, as the color of the vial has shifted to a solid red, welcoming the new discovery.
37. A young king, resplendent in his finest garments, strode confidently with his entourage of attendants into the city gates. The inhabitants of the city, who lined the streets, remained expressionless and unmoved, their supposed welcome a mere pretense. As they marched on, the imposing silhouette of the castle loomed into view, its grey stone walls shrouded in the morning mist. The king's heart raced with anticipation as he imagined the throne room within, and the destiny that awaited him.
38. A river of liquid copper, gold, or quicksilver.
39. A giant eye, peering into reality from a crack in the sky.
40. A carousel, moving, but with no passengers or people around.
41. An abandoned ice-cream truck, moldering away in a primeval forest, music still playing.
42. A wall of screens taller than a person and a mile long, each playing a different episode of the same sitcom, out of order and with no context. Occasionally the screens talk to each other, as if they know the other episodes are there, or that someone may be watching them, then the episode ends and the next one starts. The same exact episode is never played more than once.
43. Hidden among all these Echoes is an actual Ghost.
44. The ground shakes as a long forgotten behemoth creature walks by only to fade from existance.
45. You enter a lush valley, you see the smiling face of a massive elemental being on a nearby hillside. The face vanishes and the vegetation turns sickly in its absense.
46. A blue humanoid with yellow eyes and no mouth tinkers with a device on a table. He turns towards you, looks surprised, then motions for you to leave as he fades from existance.
47. The temperature turns cold and the world becomes encased in ice. Fur covered dwarves huddle in the glacial caves while a castle of ice rises in the distance.
48. Warriors riding giant insects rush by you to attack a skeletal titan. The titan is controlled by a demon impaled on its ribs.
49. A young child trips over a stone and cuts her leg. She transforms into a terrifying monster and destroys the stone.
50. The ruins of an old town peaking out of a large lake. By looking deeper the players find what was once a town that had been here, but became submerged by water as a result of storms. There are no skeletons, but the buildings have become familiar with the seaweed and underwater life of the lake.
51. A smiling man with dark skin and long, black hair stands at the helm of a deep green pirate ship. He opens his eyes. All 7 of them.
52. A small village of thatched roofs burns in the twilight. A hag stands cackling in the distance.
53. An ominous horseman in a crimson cape and hood, standing silently on the top of a hill. His eyes are blank and he doesn't have lips, showing all of his front teeth. He seems to look fait away in the horizon.-Mot
54. For centuries, a fierce battle has been raging in the skies above a city. On one side is a powerful angelic figure, a divine embodiment of justice, righteousness and goodness. On the other side is its demonic counterpart, a force of malevolence and wickedness. The fate of the city hangs in the balance, as its citizens await the outcome of this epic struggle between good and evil. If the angelic figure prevails, the city will be blessed with peace, joy and contentment, while a victory for the demonic figure will plunge the city into darkness, despair and chaos.
55. Two young lovers in a tight embrace, lounging together as they watched the beautiful sunrise that stretched out over the towering view in front of them. Despite the uncertainty of their future and the restrictions their parents and society had imposed on them, they committed to do everything in their power to make their relationship work. They shared a moment of peace, admiring the beauty of the sunrise and dreaming of the possibilities that lay ahead of them.
56. The warrior kneels beside his friend, who is gravely injured from the battle that is still raging around them. He takes his hand, feeling the warmth and life slowly fading away. Knowing this will be their final moment together, he promises to take care of his family, vowing to make sure they are provided for in the future. The dying warrior looks up at him with a grateful and familiar smile, and with one last breath, his soul departs. The kneeling warrior grasps his friend's hand tightly, holding back tears as he silently bids farewell.
57. The authoritative knight galloped through the street on his trusted steed, seemingly without a care for the citizens around him. A small young boy stood in his path, seemingly about to be run over when a heroic young girl jumped in front of him and managed to stop the knight in his tracks. The knight, completely oblivious of the danger he had almost caused, continued on his path, leaving the young boy with a sense of shock and awe. The young boy quickly recovered, and with a humble sense of gratitude, thanked the girl for saving him.
58. A scrawny stray cat cautiously trots up to a homeless woman, who was leaning against a wall, fast asleep. The woman stirred and opened her eyes, only to find the tiny cat rubbing against her leg. Her face lit up with a warm smile and she reached into her bag to pull out a bowl of water and a few scraps of food. The cat eagerly lapped up the cool water and devoured the food, purring appreciatively as it nestled in the woman's outstretched arms.
59. A large library is the backdrop for an unlikely duo - a half-orc barbarian and an elf wizard. The wizard is patiently instructing the half-orc in the basics of reading and writing, starting with the alphabet. Despite his gruff demeanor, the half-orc is evidently making progress and has already managed to learn a few letters. With a bit more time and effort, it's possible the half-orc could master the entire alphabet.
60. A regal demon prince lounged around a luxurious dinner table in a dimly lit hall, attended by a troupe of beguiling succubi, serving his every need. Standing awkwardly and aloof in front of the table, a tiefling warlock appeared. The demon prince smiled with a mischievous glint in his eye, and the two began a conversation concerning their previous contract. The demon prince insisted that he would aid the tiefling in finding her long-lost daughter, but in exchange, she must accept the corruption of pleasure and servitude. With great hesitation and a heavy heart, the tiefling reluctantly agreed.
61. The giant teenager was throwing a temper tantrum, demanding to her father that she be allowed to go out and smash any humanoids she could find in the vicinity. Her hulking father seemed to share her enthusiasm, but urged her to be mindful of not angering too many people at once. He wanted her to be strategic in her actions, so as not to draw too much attention or cause too much chaos.
62. The evil lich cackled maniacally in their shadowy crypt, admiring the intricate schematics of their sinister plot to conquer the world and bend its subjugated inhabitants to their will. Suddenly, one of the lich's skeletal servants happened to stumble into the table, causing several of the papers to scatter around the room. This provoked a violent outburst from the lich, who cast a necrotic spell to immediately annihilate the unfortunate minion. After regaining his composure, the lich retreated to his private chambers, where he encountered his undead kitten. Softening his expression, the lich began to pet the feline vigorously, seeking comfort in the small creature's presence.
63. The magical professor asked the class a question about the importance of proper speaking and gesturing to successfully cast a spell. One student raised their hand, and when allowed to answer, they replied, ""You really need to address that wart, professor."" This resulted in the class bursting into laughter, and the professor struggled to maintain composure as he demanded the student answer his question instead of distracting the class.
64. An ancient city, long forgotten and submerged beneath the depths of the ocean, emerged from the depths. The walls of the buildings were still covered in a variety of sea life.
65. The adventurers face a daunting task, standing before a portal to the demonic plane, surrounded by countless fallen demons. With a tremendous effort, one of the brave adventurers casts a powerful spell to banish the portal. In a climatic moment, the portal shatters, and the entire group watches in awe as the spell caster collapses to the ground in exhaustion. The rest of the party rallies around them in solidarity and support."
254,"Hi there! I am looking for a collection of jokes or puns a generally good-natured classic fantasy dwarf might find funny or say with a cheeky grin or a chuckle.


I did some searching of the web but didn't find much that fit what I was looking for so I'm hoping we can come up with some for the benefit of myself and future searchers.

Specifically this is jokes by / for dwarfs, rather than what someone else would say *about* dwarfs, but some light self-deprecation about e.g. height still works. 

Usual tropes are in effect, stuff related to those is fair game. Being actually funny / making sense to a non-dwarf is optional. Beyond that, anything about e.g. life underground, mining, rock puns, or anything else that you think of. Non-dwarf specific puns that someone might say in-setting (i.e. not referencing game mechanics) are fair game too.

I think this sort of thing usually turns into a bunch of race-based insults (e.g. all about how much they love killing orcs or [something about elves]( This is okay to a certain extent, but I'd prefer it be kept at a level of playful banter as opposed to being outright hostile as I think there's plenty of dwarf insults to be found on the web already and that doesn't fit the vibe I'm looking for.

Additional prompts if you want to make them at all more specific to the setting which prompted this (totally optional): 

* Dwarfs are not born, but rather a bunch are carved out of appropriately-sized rocks and given life at the same time in a big festival every 10 years coming out fully grown (but knowing very little) and being taught alongside their cohort/by their 'parents'.

* A light degree of astrology-like assumptions about other dwarfs based on what kind of rock they were carved from, and a tradition of 'families' choosing to carve new members from the same kind of rock.

258,"I am trying to get dinosaur, island survival, and primitive survival themed events that could happen.

1. A tropical storm washes over the island and is followed by a pack of velociraptors using the storm as cover to stealthy hunt the players.
2. Witness the birth of a Dino/hatching of an egg.
3. Encounter a dinosaur that is sick and needs your help.
4. A compy swarm is in the area, thieving what food they can, and will wait for any individual to become isolated and attack them.
5. Find a carnivore infant that is injured. If you help it, its screams attract the parents."
259,"I'm currently trying to make a way for combat to be more engaging when it's not a player's turn. I'd love some help in brainstorming reactions that people could use in combat (preferably not super OP). 

1. **Ready for Triage:** If an ally is damaged, and are in range, you can use your reaction to heal them. The range is whatever the range of the healing spell you’re using is. 
2. **Overwatch:** If you are at least 35 feet away from an enemy that moves more than 15 feet you may use your reaction to cast a spell up to level 2 against them. 
3. **Saving Grace:** If an enemy would hit you, meeting your AC, you may use your reaction to increase your AC by 1 until the end of that enemy's turn.
4. **Taunt:** If you are within 10 feet of an ally and they would take less than 10 damage, you can use your reaction to redirect their attack onto you, and reduce it by 1d4.
5. **Lone Wolf:** If you are at least 35 feet from an ally your attacks gain 1d4 damage of the same type of whatever your attack is.
6. **Together at Arms:** If you and an ally within 10 feet are attacked by the same enemy on the same round, you can both gain 1d4 temporary HP that disappears at the end of the round.
7. **Covering Fire:** You can sacrifice your next action to either use a melee weapon to wildly hack and slash into an empty adjoining hex, or to use a ranged weapon to wildly fire into an empty hex within range. If anyone (friend or foe) enters that hex before your next action would have normally been, roll to determine if you hit and if so damage as if you had made a normal attack against that creature. If you hit, the creature can't move out of that hex this round even if it has movement points left.
8. **On Your Toes:** Use your reaction to prepare to quickly move or dodge in anticipation of an attack. Gain advantage on one Dexterity-based saving throw in this round.
9. **Watch the Rogue:** You are keeping a wary eye on one particular enemy (you must specify which one). If that enemy uses the Hide action this round, its attack on you is not at advantage, and your attack on it is not at disadvantage.
10. **Overkill (weapon property):** If you roll 10 or more above the opponent's AC, roll an additional damage die
11. **Pocket Mercy:** If you have healed the same person twice in a row you may heal them as a reaction for an extra 2d4 HP the next time they are attacked and you are within 15 feet.
12. **LEEROY JENKINS:** a melee character gets an opportunity to surprise an enemy within the closest range while screaming something as a distraction. (feel free to change it in anyway. i just came up with the possible consept)
13. **Bleep This:** You run your full move away from combat. You drop your weapon. +2 to avoid attack."
260,"In shows such as Star Trek, episodes often have a main conflict - the ""A"" plot - and a secondary story - the ""B"" plot - involving characters not at the forefront of the main conflict. For GMs running games in such settings, this list is a collection of ideas to introduce B plots into missions which might otherwise feel one-dimensional. The B plot also sometimes provides helpful elements to resolve the A plot.

These entries are mostly written for a Trek style, with a large ship and crew, but most should work with smaller, Firefly-style crews or possibly military sci-fi like Stargate which have a cast of NPCs in addition to the PCs.

1. Someone's pet is having babies. Bonus: the being is troublesome in some way. /masterwork_spoon
2. A crew member receives a troubling letter from home, but can't act on it. /masterwork_spoon
3. An NPC crew member struggles with an addiction. /masterwork_spoon
4. Someone is ""gundecking"" the maintenance logs (claiming to inspect, but just passing it on paper) of a non-critical system. /masterwork_spoon
5. The crew has been passing the same head cold/space flu around for an unusually long time. Bonus (by /gnurdette): it coincides with a rumor of a new deadly interstellar plague. Probably a coincidence. /masterwork_spoon
6. It's annual performance review time. /masterwork_spoon
7. An auditor from Command is asking lots of questions. /masterwork_spoon
8. A self-important diplomat is expecting the captain/crew's full attention just as the main plot begins. /masterwork_spoon
9. The ship's cook picked up a load of a novel new ingredient, and is putting it in everything (possibly because it's good, possibly because they *think* it's good, or because it represents the bulk of supplies available right now). This is causing *complications*. /masterwork_spoon
10. An anonymous journal is found aboard the ship which contains multiple entries severely critical of the captain (edit: and/or other members of the crew). The author may be trying to retrieve it before analysis determines who they are. /masterwork_spoon
11. A shy crew member has a crush, but is too nervous to act on it, and is pestering other crew members for advice, assistance, and so on. /sonofabutch
12. Married crew members had a bitter fight and are impossible to be around right now. Even worse they are assigned to the same task, compartment, or away mission, making it difficult for everyone else. (But deep down still love each other.) /sonofabutch
13. A young ensign on board has been spending way too much “private time” in the holodeck, recreation area, or off-duty lounge, and naturally the officer least comfortable with such situations (the stern warrior, the crusty X.O., the ensign’s own mother who is an officer on the ship) is the one assigned to address it. /sonofabutch
14. The captain (or Starfleet regulations or ship’s custom or whatever) has instituted a strict policy against intimate relationships with subordinates. This makes life very lonely for our poor captain, as everyone is a subordinate. Until the day the ship gets a civilian visitor… /sonofabutch
15. An alien, android, computer, or God-like being asks you to explain this bizarre human concept, I believe you refer to it as… “love”? /sonofabutch
16. Command is rolling out ugly new standards for uniforms, ship's interior design, etc. /gnurdette
17. A sales rep is using emergency comm channels to offer unbelievable deals on quality aftermarket thrust boosters. /gnurdette
18. Somebody brings an alien creature aboard as a pet. /gnurdette
19. There's an unnerving smell in the air system. It's getting worse. /gnurdette
20. It's somebody's birthday! The big 5-0! (or 4-0, 3-0, 5-0-0, whatever). How will you celebrate? What will you get them? /gnurdette
21. A journalist wants to ride along for a ""day in the life of"" story. /gnurdette
22. A passenger is trying to escape a quarantine restriction they insist is bogus. /gnurdette
23. Anti-tech passengers who insist that everything about the ship and its travels are demonic and/or illusory. /gnurdette
24. Food and other items ""vanish” and soon it becomes clear there’s a stowaway aboard. The recently discovered stowaway is a kid 12-14 years old who refuses to admit when and where they snuck aboard. /MyEvilTwin47
25. The child of a senior officer works on an AI for the school science fair, but the AI escapes the kid’s computer terminal and wreaks havoc in the ship’s computer systems, one department at a time. /MyEvilTwin47
26. During shore leave, a crewmate falls in love with a local and wants to either bring them aboard or stay on the planet. /RealRamessesII
27. The TV/stereo/holodeck is on the fritz and people are becoming dangerously bored. /RealRamessesII
28. There’s an underground gambling ring among the crew for booze/rations/better work assignments. /RealRamessesII
29. A minor item the ship carries (such as a certain type of food) is extremely valuable in the local system and enterprising crewmates scramble to take advantage. /RealRamessesII
30. There's a new show/game that is way too popular and people are shirking work to indulge in it. /gnurdette
31. A crewmember is injured by an apparent equipment malfunction. An investigation reveals it was actually intentional sabotage aimed at injuring/killing the crewmember. Officers are assigned to determine the culprits. /Argent_Knight
32. A creature has snuck onboard at the last stop. Its running around the ship causing mischief. /World_of_Ideas
33. An enemy shows up /World_of_Ideas
34. An immunization shot that the crew receives has debilitating effects. Unfortunately, there is no time to wait for the effects to wear off when the main plot starts. /World_of_Ideas
35. An inconvenient but not critical system fails as the main plot starts / The engineer has partially disassembled it for a routine maintenance check. /World_of_Ideas
36. A psychic broadcast is causing crew members to hallucinate. /World_of_Ideas
37. A rival shows up /World_of_Ideas
38. During a planet side mission or shore leave one or more of the NPC crew members gets abducted. Something unrelated to the main plot. /World_of_Ideas
39. During a planet side mission or shore leave one or more of the NPC crew members gets arrested for something unrelated to the main plot. /World_of_Ideas
40. One or more of the crew is in an EVA suit working on the outer hull, when the main plot starts. /World_of_Ideas
41. New cadets from the academy are being taken on a tour of the ship as the main plot starts. /World_of_Ideas

47. The crew are scheduled for physical examinations precisely 32 hours after their next docking and are desperately trying to find a way to practice endurance runs and the like on a cramped ship (inspired by a sadly common occurrence for USN submarine crews). /dWintermut3
48. In preparation for heavy action, or maybe just due to the vagaries of military logistics or an overcautious captain, some of the crew find themselves with new bunkmates-- 150 megaton H3 fusion warheads. munitions are being stored everywhere possible, warheads in bunks, MHD railgun slugs in the broom closet, people are tripping over reels of 5mm memory wire for the point defense guns in the corridors, etc. (inspired by WWII submarines, where crew often slept beside torpedo bodies or warheads) /dWintermut3 ( /masterwork_spoon: Not limited to weapons, this could be any type of supplies, especially items whose nature as well as presence makes the crew uncomfortable.)
49. Scuttlebutt says a top secret munition or device has been installed aboard, but no one knows what or where. turns out the rumor is wrong, but that doesn't stop the crew from looking! and possibly even identifying something random (a collection of random of spare parts, a crewman's art project, etc) as the new wonder-weapon of the admiralty. /dWintermut3 ( /masterwork_spoon: From the perspective of an enlisted party, this could be a wild goose chase; from the perspective of a command staff party, this could be a problem with crew poking their noses into things).
50. A vital diplomat is brought onboard. no one was told their biological needs (temperature, humidity, pressure, etc) are at the far end of the crew's comfort range. /dWintermut3
51. Heat is a critical issue for all spacecraft, because can't easily radiate it especially under fire when radiators can't be extended through the armor. in preparation for action the captain has ordered the heat budget lowered 30% to leave more room for maneuvering and weapon fire. Bunk rooms are now 10\*c, noncritical spaces are colder, duty stations are chilly enough to see your breath. /dWintermut3
52. The crew must figure out a way to include everyone in ""music night"" when the sensory organs of some crew members turn out to be incompatible with some of the instruments. /Powman_7
53. The ship is tasked with transporting two tribes on a pilgrimage/migration. Unfortunately, the two groups refuse to be in close proximity with one another. /Powman_7
54. The ship is in dock, which means it's mail time! All sorts of drama surrounding everyone's packages ensues. Good news/bad news from home, a box of homemade treats, letters from a sweetheart. Maybe somebody didn't get something they expected. /Powman_7
55. Planning a surprise party for someone! /Powman_7 (Bonus: the recipient of the party doesn't really want it, or doesn't like surprises /masterwork_spoon)
56. There is a important official aboard. They are either incompetent or have it out for the PCs. The PCs are going to have to distract them or do things in secret if they want to get anything done.  /World_of_Ideas
57. A spammy advertising message is being broadcast from your ship at random intervals. /masterwork_spoon with inspiration from /World_of_Ideas
58. An NPC on the ship wanted to get their work done faster, and used the ship's computer to create a simulation of themselves (holodeck, virtual simulation, hologram, etc.). There is much confusion about who is the real crew member and their ability to follow natural-language instructions. /masterwork_spoon with inspiration from /World_of_Ideas
59. A NPC, that you have to deal with, thinks that someone on your ship is their (chosen one, god, messiah, prophet, savior). They are making a nuisance of themselves and interfering with work. /World_of_Ideas
60. A prisoner escapes the brig and is now somewhere on the ship. /World_of_Ideas
61. A scientist is trying to conduct an important experiment in one of the science labs. Any power fluctuations or high-G maneuvers might ruin it. /World_of_Ideas
62. A software update causes the translators to malfunction. Now the PCs have to find people who can actually speak both languages to translate. /World_of_Ideas
63. Food stores spoil. They were improperly packaged, or a fungus got onboard, or the refrigeration systems failed. It will be about a week or two before the ship can reach a (planet, outpost, space station) where it can restock. /World_of_Ideas
64. A peaceful group of some sort (religious, commercial, or other non-militia) has come aboard for legitimate reasons, but now they claim ownership of the vessel. They remain as unobtrusive as possible except for voicing their claims. /masterwork_spoon with inspiration from /World_of_Ideas
65. The main power source needs routine maintenance, but a critical part is found to be out of stock. Until a replacement can be assembled and it is fixed, the ship is running at half its normal power. Non-critical systems have to be shut down, causing various inconveniences among the crew as the power is required for main operations. /masterwork_spoon with inspiration from /World_of_Ideas
66. Several notable NPC crew members are not aboard ship when urgent business requires the ship's presence elsewhere. /masterwork_spoon with inspiration from /World_of_Ideas
67. There's a contest among the crew - a talent show, championship game in an intramural sports league, a gaming tournament, what have you - and excitement is running high. /gnurdette
68. The crew has discovered an astronomical body or alien species and is entitled to name it. The debate is getting fierce. /gnurdette"

267,"Hags are known to plot and scheme with the sole intent of making the mortals as miserable as they can be. Sometimes, PCs get tangled into one of such plots. Sometimes they uncover one. So let's make some plots!

&#x200B;

1. An ordinary looking woman approaches the PCs on the road, lamenting that her daughter was kidnapped, and who knows what the brigands will do to her... luckily, it's not long ago, so if the PCs make haste, they might just catch the kidnappers. She promises them her golden brooch as reward. .... the woman is actually a hag who was about to devour the girl, as hags do. The girl was rescued, and it is the rescuers the party is after. If they don't talk first, the PCs will likely wipe the rescurers out. The girl will be in shock, and offer next to no resistance to being led back. 
2. While the PCs are shopping and find something they want, but is too costly for them (e.g. plate mail), an older gentleman will offer to buy it for them, in exchange for a simple service: to deliver a letter to a clerk living in the capital. ... the gentleman is a hag in disguise, and the only suspicious phrase in the whole letter is ""it's time to begin"". The very next day after delivering the letter the Capital is swept in riot that hijacks the parade of the city watch. Things escalate, and before PCs know it, many are dead or injured and couple of houses are ablaze
3. The PCs walk through a village, when they are approached by rather good looking young woman. She explains that her boyfriend recently left her without a word for another girl, and is about to merry her. She believes he was enchanted by some magic, and needs the PCs to prevent the wedding from happening. .... the young woman is a hag, who cursed the man to be a frog. Through some true love shenanigans, he is himself again, but will permanently turn back into a frog if he and his love don't marry before the sun sets. 
4. The PCs are walking in the streets of a town, when they hear a beggar shouting that the lord is about to be poisoned. There seem to be some guards approaching to remove the beggar from the streets. If the PCs approach, they will be explained that the beggar overheared a plot to poison the lord, and managed to get an antidote. However, being a beggar, she can't exactly get to the palace. So, she asks the PCs  to get into the palace, and give the antidote to the lord, should he be poisoned. ... the lord is indeed about to be poisoned (through some other scheme of the hag), but with relatively mild poison. One that causes you to be sick, but doesn't kill. The antidote the PCs get is general purpose antitoxin. However, when it's mixed with the mild poison, it becomes a deadly poison that basically rots away all the intestines. Thus, painfully, killing the lord.
5. The PCs hear about a village plagued by a vampire. Upon further investigation, they uncover that the vampire is the local miller's daughter, who is assumed to have died some months ago. Turns out, her father was wrecked by grief when she died, and approached a hag, pleading for bringing his daughter back to life. She made her a vampire, however her father refuses to see it as anything but ""a food preference"" and covers up for her."

271,"So I'm developing a quest for my homebrew called ""Home-a-Gmone"" in which an eccentric wizard/artificer gnome has locked himself inside his mansion citing a protest of the most recent election.

The mansion has 5 floors, 20 rooms per floor, and each room is trapped/cursed/or will trick the player in some way. Accepting all ideas for traps:

1. As players enter they no longer speak common or undercommon and can only communicate in other languages if the player know know other languages they only can speak incoherent jibberish. The players but all read a ""Tome of Greater Lexicon"" to regain common and exit.
2. Players all blinded as they enter the room, must navigate out by feel alone."
272,"A list of how necromancy can be used beyond raising the dead and arggg braaiiinnsss...

... ""good"" is a matter of perspective...

1. Religious order that specializes in necromancy to preserve and mummify the dead.
2. Necromancer detectives that speak with the dead, ghosts, and spirits to help solve crimes.
3. Necromancers are the ""managers"" of the mummy, zombie, and ghost working class.
4. Necromancy is taught to the healers of the world so they know how to set bones or heal dead or dying body parts and organs.
5. Necromancers are essential to warfare. When warriors, their mounts, or pack animals die, they can be healed or revived.
6. Necromancers sell trinkets, wards, tattoos, bone etchings, that prevent soldiers from being revived in battle.
7. There's pet revival shops. If your child's pet dies, don't buy a similar one to hide the fact it died, just bring it to a necromancer and have them bring it back to life!
8. Necromancers are the caregivers to the dying, like Hospice. A death doula.
9. Necromancers own the beauty and cosmetic industry. The body dies as it ages, this beauty regimen helps slow that down!
10. Business and trade secret espionage. They sneak into crypts to steal the memories of the dead.
11. Necromancers create workers for unskilled labor jobs (bricklayer, grave digger, mining, porter, sweeper, vegetable harvester or planter, etc).
12. Necromancers use undead to work in hazardous environments (extreme cold or heat, possible collapse, radiation, toxic gas, toxic spores, etc).
13. Necromancer bounty hunters that hunt down undead criminals and monsters.
14. Necromancer ghost busters! They hunt down restless (ghost, spirits), and convince them to move on to the afterlife.
15. Exorcists. They remove malicious spirits from the people that they have possessed and banish them.
16. Raising criminals and enemies so their punishment can continue in the afterlife.
17. The soul leaves the body immediately upon death, and what remains is an empty husk. It is just meat for vultures and worms — why not use it for a higher purpose? Reduce, reuse, recycle!
18. Some warriors take a sacred oath to fight evil forever. It would be sacrilegious to allow death to prevent them from carrying out their vow.
19. Necromantic magic has been found to be particularly effective at holding off the waves of plant/nature based monstrosities that assault civilization. Necromancers are upheld as guardians/protectors.
20. Necromancers command platoons of undead in a nation's army. An alternative punishment for crime is to be sentenced to serve in said platoon.
21. Death Guard: An ancestral curse overtakes the mind of a duergar, then they're petrified and their heartstone is removed. This hearthstone is turned into a black diamond and are placed in the Airless Halls of Sleeping Heroes, guarded by the petrified oath-bound corpses of the kingsguard paladins.
22. Necromancers who have immense respect for the beauty of the circle of life.
23. Necromancers that just think skeletons are really neat.
24. Necromancers who consult with the spirits of the dead to give closure to the loved ones of someone who passed.

31. Necromancers are artisans, bone sculptors and statuary.
32. Necromancers resurrect all of the year's dead to bring in the fields and help feed everyone during harvest season.
33. Necromancers resurrecting extinct animal species.
34. Higher echelons of military ranks are undead so their vast battlefield knowledge and military tactics are not lost. They train and continue to pass on this knowledge.
35. Necromancers as maintenance workers, they fix-up the most powerful undead, war ending, elite military units.
36. Necromancers protect civilized/populated areas from the undead that keep rising for some reason.
37. Necromancy is the highest and most difficult form of magic to learn. That is why the greatest houses leaders are all necromancers.
38. Necromancers are the fist adventurers on the scene of a new location. They use their expendable undead to determine how strong or difficult a dungeon or location is.
39. Necromancers who consult with those who died without wills to settle matters of inheritance.
40. A team of necromancers controlling undead ""players"" that can perform many, many silent plays, vaudeville shows, and even voice-act over an undead's performance to an audience much easier and cheaper than hiring an entire cast and crew for a theater.
41. Necromancers that control undead assembly line workers disrupting any skill based manufacturing with undead mass production.
42. Hire necromancers to create undead dungeon security.
43. Necromantic archeologist, who mostly uses Speak with Dead and occasionally Comprehend Languages to interview subjects about their culture. They may also animate the dead to help with the digging."
273,"It can come from alien plants, crashed ship, paranormal event, etc... It only has to be edable food such as fruits, cakes, water, etc... Also, consider the planet as a desert planet, without civilization or massive life such as Mars. 

1. A very strange ark made of stone. It glows when we approach it, and then food appears from nowhere. Then, the ark doesn't glow anymore. 

2. Some plants seems to grow in this region. Pyramid shaped and blue, they are about 20 cm tall and they hide an edible core.

3. An abandoned ship is here. Its systems are dysfonctoning and the whole food storage is totally frozen. We can still retriever it.

4. Some cave hide a small river! The water is dirty but with some filtration we can drink it for sure!

5. Plants of about 10 centimeters grow here. Their fruits, gray, look like suction cups of tentacles and grow in clusters."
274,"Do you know [Sir Mordred's armour]( in Excalibur (1981)? Or the armour from the [dude in Blasphemous]( That's what I mean. Helmets with shapes, lots of draperies, and every sort of **absolute drip** that you might come across on a fully blinged out knight during a tournament.

It can also reflect the general vibe of the knight rather than what he's visually wearing.

1. *The Mad Dog Knight* \- A reddish armour with the helmet in the shape of a hunting hound and a fur coat over the shoulders, giving the knight a hunched over and menacing appearance. May also be a wolf, a lion, or a bear.
2. *The Knight of the Lake* \- A nautical themed armour with lots of blue and white, flippers on the sides of the helmet and a fin on the top and on the shoulders. Patterns of waves on the chest. Maybe has a dolphin or a shark on top of his helmet instead of the fin.
3. *The Knight of the Giant* \- The face of the helmet is made to look like an angry giant or ogre baring its teeth. The armour itself has abs and muscles sculpted on the relief, and a long mane circles the head and falls down the back.
4. *The Knight of the Bishop* \- The knight wears an open helmet with a metal mask with a greco-roman face etched on it. There's a halo on his head, a cross on his chest, and shapes of angels, fiery wheels and chariots all over the white armour.
5. *The Knight of the Crow* \- The helmet has a long beak and the overtunic is black with a crow or eagle with its wings spread out. The knight wears two silk capes, one over each shoulder, that flutter back like two spread wings when he gallops.
6. *The Knight of the Field* \- A knight with a flower garland and a wreath over his helmet. His armour is full of patterns of growing things like wheat, flowers, and tall grass.
7. *The Knight of Horns* \- The knight's helmet looks like a ram's or buck's horns, and a face of the same animal adorns his chest. His overtunic has the same colour as the fur of the animal of which he has the horns - white for a ram, tanned for a buck, and black for a bull.
8. *The Knight of the White Horse* \- There's a small figurine of a white horse on the top of the helmet of the knight, and two horses are drawn on his chest.
9. *The Knight of Tusks* \- The helmet of the knight has two curved tusks coming from his face, and it looks like he's wearing a metal boar's head.
10. *The Bee Knight* \- The entire armour of the knight is covered in a honeycomb pattern, with a yellow sash across his chest written something like ""DILIGENTIA"", or adorned with designs of bees. His helmet either looks normal, or for a more comedic knight, his helmet looks round like a bee's nest.
11. *The Rooster Knight* \- The knight wears a red feather on top of his head and his faceplate is painted red too. He wears one black ""wing"" attached to his back like a Hussar, and his overtunic is an emerald green.
12. *The Gargoyle Knight* or *The Devil Knight* \- The knight's entire armour is made to look like a gargoyle, with a terribly scary face, possibly horns of some kind and muscles drawn in relief in his chest and arms.
13. *The Knight of the Hare* \- The knight wears two white or tan feathers on top of his helmet, and a long tanned coat that is white beneath, which he changes periodically.
14. *The Knight of the Serpent* \- The helmet of the knight looks like the head of a serpent, or it looks like he has a serpent coiled atop of his helmet with two little wings. There are scaly patterns all across his armour.
15. *The Knight of the Unicorn* \- The helmet of the knight looks like a horse's head with a horn coming from the top. The knight also wears a sort of mane over his shoulders, and there's a large unicorn depicted on their chest.
16. *St. George's Knight* \- The knight wears a Roman styled armour and helmet, and all his lances and spears are coloured red at the tip. His banner depicts the moon.
17. *The Resplandescent Knight* \- The back of the helmet has what looks like a sun framing his profile, and he wears a metal mask in the shape of a human face. There's two white wings on his back that reflect the sun when he gallops, and his armour is always polished to reflect as much light as possible.
18. *The Souvenir Knight* \- The knight wears a relatively normal armour. His overtunic has very lovingly been made by either his wife or his mom with little patterns and hearts. He wears, however, much more cargo than the average knight - has saddlebags everywhere, has a belt full of little things, and loves to collect souvenirs.
19. *The Old Knight* \- Has a slightly outdated armour, probably with less plate than absolutely necessary. Everything looks very battered and worn, but well-tended and not in the least less effective. Wears hides and animal skins, probably was a mercenary, complains about his back pain and grimly talks about how close he is to dying all the time, but will probably reach 95 just out of spite. Loves hunting.
20. *The Great Knight* \- A knight with a purple cape and sash and two wings written ""GREATEST"" in one of them and ""UNDER HEAVEN"" in the other one (or ""Scotsman"", or wherever he comes from). Has a face mask with a permanently smug grin etched on it and a little crown on his head. It's all kayfabe, he likes playing the heel.
21. *The Byronic Knight* \- Wears a black armour with white or golden details, a tall white neck ruffle, and a purple tunic appearing wherever there are joints in the armour. Patterns of creeping, spiky vines are etched on the plates and a lady's handkerchief wrapped around the guard of his weapon.

22. *The Round Knight* - A knight clad in pearl-colored armor that is round and bulbous, though the knight himself may not be quite as heavyset. The design is reminiscent of an onion, but the knight does not like the comparison. The armor design is meant to reflect the knight's joyous and polite nature. [/MightyMrFish]

23. *The Knight of the Blackened Star* - A knight clad in black and golden armor. His helmet has large curved horns jutting from the side. The armor is elegantly designed, almost more fitting for a ceremony instead of combat. The armor covers the upper torso and arms of the knight, with the knight wearing elegant clothing (and chainmail) otherwise. [/MightyMrFish]

24. *The Knight of Thorns* - Armor covered in sharp spikes. The knight wearing this armor insists that a warrior should throw themselves into combat fully; mixing sword swings with full body tackles and charges. The armor is lightweight, allowing the knight to move quickly and tackle opponents to slash at them with both weapon and armor. [/MightyMrFish]

25. *The Candle Knight* - Wax pours from candles laid upon the pauldrons of this eccentric holy warrior. Under his darkened, tarnished helm glow gentle embers in their eyes. [/Kni7es]

26. *The Knight Errant* - Patchwork plate scavenged from battlefields and a hand-stitched surcoat bearing no recognizable insignia are all that distinguish this young man with a horse and a sword from a common bandit. That, and the righteous determination to make a name for himself at any cost. [/Kni7es]

27. *The Onion Knight* - a tall skinny knight stands before you. His warn dull duty grey armor lays bare his sounder frame. His teardrop shaped helmet is vertically ribbed with a small plume of feathers at its peak. The old man in the armor’s thick white mustache protrudes from under his face guard. Across his chest and on his shield is embossed a cluster of three onions. You can feel his eyes across you, like in a short moment he’s sized you up and come the correct conclusion. He seems tired and unamused by your interruption. [/rab-byte]

28. *The Carrion Knight* - A man in mismatched armor approaches. Ill fitting plates squeak and scrape together as me moves. The visor of his helmet is hooked like a beak and the crest of the helmet appears to be a vulture with it's wings stretched wide. Likewise his shield bears the image of a vulture with it's head lain low as if inspecting a fresh find. Those seem to be the only original parts of what was once surely a fine suit of armor. [/egoplasm]

29. *The Lion Knight* - Beautifully crafted armor with the image of a lion's head as the helmet with feral paws shaped as it's pauldrons. A Bright yellowish bronze follows the mane and sharp tipped teeth and claws, while silver encases everything else. [/NecessaryCornflake7]

30. *The Barnacle Knight* - The scent of fish fills your nostrils and you see a man clad in dark rusted iron armor. Embossed on the breastplate is the image of a squid with its tentacles extending and wrapping around the limbs of the armor. Sharp bonelike barnacles encrust the side of his breastplate, helm and arm. The joints rasp as he strides towards you. [/Preson]

31. *The Knight of Scars* - This knight’s helm exposes only a sour-looking mouth, wickedly scarred in a duel long ago. Further evidence of the knight’s experience can be seen on a deeply ravaged shield, as well as the knight’s mail. The once-fine blackened steel rings of this mail suit have been repeatedly rent in combat, and the gashes mended with coils of copper. Observers note that even the knight’s armor has the appearance of scars. [/onepostandbye]

32. *Knight of the Brine* - This knight’s armor is covered in sea growing growths- anemones, kelp, and urchins- all waving in the currents of an unseen tide. These living elements never seem to dry or suffer out of water. The knight bears a strong odor of salt. [/onepostandbye]

33. *Knight of Chains* - Every surface of this knight’s platemail is wrapped in coils of steel chain. Disguised among them are a some decidedly unknightly tools: a chain whip, manacles, and chain bolas. [/onepostandbye]

34. *The Knight of Jest* - This armor is painted in the style of a somber harlequin, with deep reds and forest greens, and it is accented by vicious perversions of jesters’ tropes. Jagged spurs resembling bells adorn the toes while sawlike blades painted in rainbow colors extend from the vambraces. The knight’s face is completely hidden behind a leering steel comedy mask, it’s mouth a blackened void. [/onepostandbye]

35. The Green Knight- This armor is made of a hard tarnished bronze inlaid with iron. It is warped and appears to be bark-like in nature. The helm is formed to replicate the face of a bearded, somber man with many ribbons of mossy twine creating a beard appearance. The cloak is made of old wool growing mushrooms, moss, and what appears to be wild flowers. [/comedianmasta]

36. The Sun Knight- This armor is a highly reflective breastplate trimmed with gold thread over an enchanted, silver-blue chain mail. The helm is entirely closed, instead of a slit multiple, tiny holes dot the front of the helm. In bright light or daylight, the chain mail retracts up the arms and reinforces vital areas of the core and neck. In darkness, it again spreads out, covering the arms. [/comedianmasta]

37. Gareth's Knight- This armor is a pretty typical set of knight's plate armor, but either the metal used or the finish on it creates an ever shimmering rainbow of color in the light. It appears to move and change colors depending on their movements and placement of light sources. [/comedianmasta]

38. Bard Knight- This armor is mercurial in nature and appears to be made from quicksilver and water. When still, it appears to be a light blue-grey iron, however the wearer can adjust the design / structure of the armor at will over a 5 minute span, where is moves like a gel to complete their wishes. [/comedianmasta]

39. Hercules Knight- This knight had dark plate armor arranged in layers like chitin shell. The kite shield is made of several layers, appearing like the shell of a beetle with the hint of wings starting to spread open, providing a wide breadth of cover. The helm is affixed sturdily to the pauldrons of the plate to support the garish great horn of iron protruding from the top. This gives the wearer a strange beetle-like appearance. [/comedianmasta]

40. Bubble Knight- This armor is bulky, to be worn by the largest of knights. The helm appears to be a massive cauldron where small viewing holes have been punched out for vision of the knight inside. A barnacle-encrusted breast plate matches large, bulky boots. Behind the armor is a harness and small protective cage, with foot holds and hand rests, suggesting a small rider to assist with vision, combat (rear guard) and possibly counter-balance of the large helm. [/comedianmasta]

41. *The Justicar Knight*: Armor made from a Sliver alloy reminiscent of Albaster and Marble, Carved with protective blessings, and a helmet made to resemble a Androgynous Angelic Face, with a final protective blessing Carved into its forehead. Over the armor is a Purple Alb trimed with golden patterns of gardens and paradise, said Alb being designed for easy removal before combat and includes purple stoles as well, with the design of a lion's face on it. The armor is also carved to make the arms and legs look similar to the body's own, as if the armor was metal limbs made to replace the wearers own. The Knight is a noble champion, one of few who are able to properly earn the title of ""Justicar"", by devoting themselves to their People, their home, and their God. He arrives to a help relieve a city from hellish Invaders, leading companies of allied soldiers to help turn the tide or at least give time for the civilians to get to safety [/Gmknewday1]

42. *The Reaper Knight* - a dark hood covers this knights head exposing only the skull shaped faceplate. Armor of plain well worn dark grey iron and a heavy dark cloak over his shoulders, this knight typically arms himself with either a scythe or a flail which also functions as a funeral censer. [/beckwko000]

43. *The Chromatic Knight* - this suit of plate armor is covered in a layer of paint like coating which looks a different colour depending on the angle it is viewed from. [/eDaveUK]

44. *The Charred Knight* - Fire-blackened metal plate, strangely smooth all over, flattened on the chest and shaped to a rounded taper on the faceplate, arms and legs. The magic sigils only appear near significant amounts of heat, but even without them, there's few things more terrifying than facing a knight whose armor suggests that a direct blast from a dragon wasn't enough to best them. [/AlephAndTentacles]

45. *The Beautiful Knight* - This knight is famed for their beauty. This presents quite a dilemma as they want to show off their face but not get it scarred. They've found the perfect helmet, the face mask made of some kind of mystical glass as strong as steel. [/sonofabutch]

46. *The Height Knight* - This knight is an inch shorter than average for their race, but has (low fantasy setting) lifts/heels, (steampunk setting) hydraulics in the boots, or (prevalent magic setting) a minor levitation enchantment, to allow them to appear a couple inches taller. This boosts their self-esteem but hampers their mobility. [/sonofabutch]

47. *The Unscathed Knight* - This knight wears gleaming armor without a ding, dent, or scratch on it. They are famed for their parrying ability and indeed even after the most violent battle emerges with armor untouched. However, the reality is the unscathed armor is actually an illusion, worn over another set of armor that takes the punishment. [/sonofabutch]

48. *The Mushroom Knight* - This knight wears armor made entirely of fungi, his or her head hidden inside an enormous mushroom with a broad cap. With every blow the knight takes, mushrooms go flying, and thick puffs of spores are released that can cause opponents to cough and be blinded. After a long rest, the mushrooms regrow to protect the wearer again. The armor also is delicious with olive oil and garlic. [/sonofabutch]

49. *The Vigilant Knight* - This knight's armor, shield, and helmet is enchanted to be sentient, and covered with tiny eyes that see and mouths that warn of danger. It's impossible to ambush, backstab, or otherwise surprise this knight, as the armor can see in every direction and cry out at the slightest provocation. Indeed, the armor is paranoid and screams about just about every potential source of trouble, like a worried backseat driver. When the armor, helmet, or shield is struck, it cries out in agony. [/sonofabutch]

50. *The Knight in White Satin* - This knight's armor is made of beautiful white satin, soft as silk and white as snow. But as armor goes it's a terrible choice and very quickly it will turn red with blood. [/sonofabutch]"

276,"The motel is in a modern town in the American South that the party will be going to, I want to roll to see what weird rooms they get.

1. ""Outdoorsman"" - Bad taxidermy probably found at a local garage sale, flannel sheets and a generic painting of a forest.
2. ""Honeymoon Suite"" - tacky heart-shaped bed, pink and gold accents all around the room.
3. ""Library"" - bookshelf with sparse, bland books (the rest probably stolen over the years) and 3 identical bibles, sagging red velvet reading chair that is too rickety to sit in.
4. ""Doll Room"" - covered in knick knacks and dolls, all of the furniture is old wicker furniture
5. ""50s Retro"" - flickering neon sign on the wall, you can't figure out how to turn it off. Only furniture other than the bed is half a cracked vinyl booth with an old diner table in front of it. Sort of an ice cream shop style.
6. ""1970s Carpet Room"" - All the furniture and even the walls are covered in a colorful carpet texture. The color palette is very 1970s. Even the bathroom has a carpet floor.
7. ""Murder Room"" - Someone was probably murdered in this room. You can tell from the dried stains and the lingering smell. You really can't hide that when you don't replace the carpet and bedding. Still has a chalk outline!
8. ""Elvis Room"" - There are several portrait framed pictures of the famous singer Elvis Presley. The style of the room and the bedding match the timeframe when he was alive.
9. ""Willie and Waylon"" - country music themed room. Two twin beds, a photo of Willie above one and Waylon above the other. The bathroom door doesn't close all the way, and the light switch ís the old pushbutton type. Leather couch, deerskin stools, and the window unit doesn't quite work.
10. ""The Christmas Room"" - No matter what time of year, this room is decked out in red and green, with silver tinsel and an artificial Christmas tree. ""All I Want For Christmas"" plays every time the door is opened.
11. ""The Olympian"" - Framed posters on the walls from the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and various memorabilia. There's a pommel horse, an exercise bike, and a pair of crossed fencing swords hung over the door.
12. ""The Dog Pound"" - The walls are covered with photos of dogs and there's little dog knick-knacks everywhere.
13. ""Plantation Room"" - Pictures of cotton gins and dixieland memorabilia. A bust of an old white man (vaguely looks like Coronel Sanders).
14. ""Fisherman Room"" - Bass, lures and nets for decoration. A floor lamp that has fishing rods for a frame. Aquarium. Waterbed or a bed shaped like a fishing boat. TV only plays fishing tournaments. Bad singing fish decoration.
15. ""Oil Baron"" - Stuff shaped like oil rigs (table legs, night stand). Lingering odor of petroleum products. The bath water is always black and viscous. Rocking chair that powers a pump jack.
16. ""Roman room"" - Rome themed with a hot tub, roses, and a robust turkey dinner
17. ""Pink Cadillac"" - it’s just a green room with a pink caddy in it. The car is fully functional with a well preserved tank of gas.
18. ""Leather grotto"" - it’s a leatherworks, like to make horse accoutrements. Lots of leather stock, buttons, and holds on the walls.
19. ""Beef jerky room"" - you hit the mother lode! This room is a simple hotel room, but with a beef jerky bar included!!
20. ""The Aquarium"" - an ocean themed room with a huge fish tank, as well as several other tanks. They have fish and coral or whatever.
21. ""Growing Room"" - every part of the room is covered in plants that are being kept under grow lights. Party can roll to identify plants. Allows DM to decide if these are obvious Drug Plants like expected, or if the owner is into Horticulture.
22. ""Smoking Room"" - The smell of old cigarettes and cigars chokes the air in this room. Players need to roll or be left coughing for 1d4 rounds from the putrid air. Cigarette butts litter every ashtray and garbage can in the room.
23. ""Cult Room"" - First glance room looks to be a cult meeting room. A large pentagram takes up the middle of the floor. A pile of blood and bones piled neatly in the middle. An Unseeing Eye (missing pupil) takes up on wall looking up a bunch of hooks and chains connected to the opposite wall. An investigation check reveals its all fake. Blood is fake, the bones are KFC, The chains are spray painted cardboard.
24. ""Ballroom dance room"" - a medium sized dance floor with a separate bedroom. Faux elegant.
25. ""Kids Room"" - Rainbow Brite, toys, and Care Bears room with faded colors from the sun.

Edit: I got so many great responses that I have to make it two rolls now! I think I'll do a D6 and then a D4! Thank you so much everyone!"

283,"I found most a few years back. I've been using them for my games and love them. I didn't make any note of where I found them but most I did not come up with. I know quite a few come from other D100 tables from here.

 

1. Yvain the knight on a lion looking for a magic stone guarded by the knight esclados looking for revenge for his brother
2. In the woods you find a magic standing stone, where if water is poured on it, the stone will cause a powerful and devastating storm. It is protected by the knight Esclados.
3. You find a man chained up next to 6 devoured courpes. He tells how every night a wolf has devoured his brothers and how he is all that is left. He was overthrowen and the new king left him here to die.
4. In the wood you find an abandon cabin. In the cabin there is a shrine with a wolfskin draped on it. If the wolf skin is put on they are turned into a wolf. They will not revert back till there hp is 0 where they will revert back to their true form with all there normal hp. 
5. A strong gust of wind flys past you knocking you over. Shotly after and man runs up to you breathless. He tells how the wind is a wizarded riding a magic horse who stole his wife.
6. You find a giant black wolf  tied up in the woods with a little red ribbin tied with a beautiful bow. he begs to be set free. 
7. You find a boy in the woods who is traveling to the next town over. He got kicked out of his temple because he couldn’t stop drawing cats every where. Later the party should hear of a young magica who killed the goblin-rat with pictures of cats.
8. A large black dog comes to the party In the middle of the night . It looks wild and hungry but will not leae the party. After some time the dog barks into the woods as a group of bandits emerge. The dog helps the party fight off the badites and then disappears.
9. The party passes by a forest of termite hills 6ft tall. Once in the “forest” the hobgblin clan spring out to attack.
10. When hunting you find stage pig like tracks with wet spots like rain all around it. If fallowed they will find a grotesque pig with floppy skin boiled and moles. Once the Squonk sees the party it will cry itself into a pool of tearis. 
11. When hunting you find a golden stage said to be blessed by the goddess of nature. 
12. You find a garden with golden apples in the center being guarded by a giant serpent. 
13. You run into a Fenodyree who asks if you have a chore that could be done. It was banished out of the fey count because he didnt do his chores. For him to return he must help 10,000 mortals with their chores. Hes naked and very hairy and gets mad at the offer of clothing.
14. In the woods you find an orc woman. She invites you to camp with her and she tells of how her husband is a great warrior. He left some years back to gainn glory and renown. She feeds the party and gives them a safe place to sleep. In the moring she is a wistherd husk her tent and camp grounds look like they have been abandoned for years.
15. You go into the woods and meet a wise women. She is a god indiguise. She tells the party that the woods hold a beast that will kill them. That is a test set by the gods and there job is to survive.
16. During the middle of the rest, a strange goblin approaches the camp. He is looking for directions to the nearest city. If helped, players can find him in the city to which they pointed him off. He might even give them a reward.
17. Other adventures are lost and need directions
18. As you turn the corner, a dwarf and elf are standing over a stack of goblin corpses. They argue over the kill count.
19. There is a tree with deep scratches in it as if it has been attacked by a dagger. Upon inspection, the player discovers old, dried blood embedded in the bark and writing in a deep red color that says ‘Find me, help me’ (illusory script). As the party continues they see more trees of a similar nature, and eventually find a crazed gnome  who is determined to eat party members in order to restore his youth. (half a day)
20. You come across the last survivor of a pack of peaceful werewolves who are being hunted by vicious werewolf hunters He/she asks you to return him to the rest of the clan.
21. Just ahead of you, you find a herd of deer. As you get closer, in the center, you find a golden stag with platinum antlers. All the deer run. To chase the stag DC 10 survival every 500 yeards with DC 18 to hit the animal of 20hp. After some time, The stag greets the characters in Sylvan. If none of the characters speak that language, it switches to Elvish. If no one responds again, it tries heavily accented, pidgin Common. It assures them that they are on the right track, and they must continue following the river of gold until they reach the castle in the sky. Sadly, their path will be filled with hardship and blood. To aid them, it offers the character a +1 longbow. The bow appears on the ground before them, and then the stag fades from view saying, 'Not all will survive…
22. Just ahead of you, you find a herd of deer. As you get closer, in the center, you find a golden stag with platinum antlers. All the deer run. To chase the stag DC 10 survival every 500 yeards with DC 18 to hit the animal of 20hp. They fallow the stage to a ruined castle. When the characters search the tumbled ruins, they find no sign of the stag but see a thin person who resembles a wood elf with bright golden skin. The young male is naked, and either is wearing an antlered headpiece or has delicate antlers growing from his head. He drops to his knees and beseeches the characters in a dialect of Elvish that is archaic but understandable. He is an elf prince, and the stones around them were once the beautiful castle where he ruled. But he was cursed by the father of the woman he loved to transform into a golden stag whenever he steps outside these walls. He has lived with the curse for so long that his kingdom is forgotten, his castle is fallen to ruin, and he no longer remembers his own name. He believes that a wizard somewhere can release him from the curse, but wherever he goes, people try to kill him for his golden coat. If the characters allow him to accompany them and protect him, he will do his best to reward them at the end of the journey. The story is true; several wizards in Waterdeep could remove the curse. The elf cannot pay a reward at the end, but the characters earn 500 XP apiece for believing him and protecting him. That job won't be easy, because people in the caravan find their story ridiculous and look for opportunities to kill the stag.
23. A camouflaged giant 
24. Trapdoor spider nest, 15 feet in diameter.
25. A pile of shit with human clothes, hair, and bones in.
26. Traveling off the main road, the PCs feel like they are being followed. Who is hunting them or what?
27. You find a massive circle of felled trees, in the center of which is a malnourished and wild-eyed greataxe wielding orc yelling about fending off an endless hoard of regrowing enemies.
28. You smell something cooking. There is a nearby goblin camp and they are roasting a pig on a spit. They don’t notice the player unless they are particularly careless.
29. While moving through a river a few faintly glowing leeches attach themselves, but it’s not blood they’re draining but magic itself.
30. An alone child that refuses to talk but will hold one of the adventures hands, and theirs alone (normally while sucking her thumb). If the child feels threatened, she will run away from the party and they won’t be able to find her again. There are no tracks. (Optional: If they look after her for a night, she will leave them a gift.)
31. hunters trap If the players get traped (half a day)
32. A meteor lands nearby.
33. A meteor shower
34. A drunken Dwarf staggers along, challenging everyone to a wrestling match
35. An ecstatic farmer presses a cigar into your hands and proclaims, 'It’s a girl!'
36. A herded joins them on the road. A pack of wolves are chasing the herd. If the party helps then (half a day)
37. A merchant’s wagon has shattered a wheel and he offers passers-by cut-rate prices on his wares as it is getting repaired.
38. A naked bard who was robed askes for help.
39. The road crests a hill and spread out before the group is a stunning, sweeping vista of the land beyond. A painter sits nearby, capturing the scene, and asks the group to pose for his foreground. If the part stays(half a day)
40. Two other adventuring groups are arguing in the middle of the road.
41. An ugly old woman struggles to bring her wash basket of wet clothes up from the creek to the road. She stumbles and drops the laundry back down the slope.
42. You encounter a monk, a monkey, a turtle, and a pig, all heading west.
43. The road comes to a large river. A new, high-quality bridge has been built over the river by a goblin clan who are seeking to overcome evil natures and to make an honest living. They are charging what is, in fact, a high if still fair fee.
44. A worried-looking half-orc desperately tries to convince your party they are going the wrong way, and that they should take a similar (if slightly longer) trail to their destination. A religion check reveals that he is a cleric of a knowledge deity. If the party ignores him, he tries to convince them for a while, then shakes his head sadly and begins trudging away
45. You come across 2 NPC’s arguing over which one is real, and which is a hallucination.
46. An imp caught in a rabbit trap, screeching loudly.
47. On the road, you find a group of actors posing as adventures. They'll tell stories of battling great creatures, but the second the going gets tough they get going. they only wanted to be with the party for free protection.
48. As the party rounds a bend in the road, a human head can be seen sitting in the middle of the road a hundred yards ahead. DC 15 perception recognizes that the head is actually a person buried up to the neck, and he is unconscious but still alive. That fact is evident to anyone who approaches within 10 yards, as is the word 'Oathbreaker' painted on his forehead. The buried human is in bad shape from exposure and dehydration. Any healing magic or some water and a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check to revive him.  It's obvious from wheel tracks on the turned-over earth that other wagons have indeed passed him by during the last few days. Digging the man out of the ground takes two diggers at least two hours, and refilling the hole takes another hour (you can't just leave a hole in the road). The buried man is Carlon Amoffel. He is a human spy and a member of the Harpers; characters discover a Harper tattoo on his arm if they dig him up. He has nothing but the loincloth he was buried in. Publicly, Amoffel's story is that the oath he broke was a promise to marry a woman. He broke the engagement because he discovered that her father and brothers were all bandits and that he was expected to join them. If any of the characters are Harpers and they reveal their association to Amoffel, he tells them the real story. He was tracking a shipment of stolen loot north. But the smugglers—he's sure they're members of the Cult of the Dragon—became suspicious of him. Amoffel passed information to another Harper at a roadside inn, and members of the caravan witnessed the meeting. The cultists manufactured a story that he was giving information to bandits. The merchants were unwilling to kill him outright, but they were willing to leave him buried in the road and 'let providence decide the man's fate Amoffel has Harper contacts in Waterdeep and knows his way around the city. He can be a useful ally when this caravan reaches its destination.
49. After a miserably wet, cold day that promises to become an even more soaked, freezing night, the party arrives at a large inn. Upon entering the warm, comfortable common room to make arrangements for the night, the embarrassed innkeeper tells the characters that the entire inn is sold out; all the private rooms are taken, and the common room is reserved for a private party. The caravan will need to spend the night outside. Looking around the room, the characters see just one group: an aristocratic judge and his entourage of three human dilettantes. They smirk at the characters while making comments such as 'sleep tight' and 'have a pleasant evening' followed by insults muttered under their breath about the characters' mud-spattered clothing and low breeding. If characters ask about sleeping in the stable, one of the nobles speaks up, saying, 'Our horses are rather picky about who they share space with. We had to reserve all of it, too, for their sake. You understand, I'm sure.' His snooty friends have a good chuckle over that. The NPCs in the inn won't be influenced by any sort of reason or debate or by offers of money. They find the situation enormously amusing and seem pleased by the prospect of the players suffering in the freezing rain all night. They needle and goad the characters and their fellow travelers at every opportunity, including from the doorway and windows of the inn when no one else is inside. In fact, these NPCs are four disguised veterans traveling to Baldur's Gate in search of employment and out to have a good laugh over someone's misfortune. They drop all pretense after violence breaks out
50. An awakened tree waits for a surprise attack
51. Bandits attack with their captain
52. An overturned beer cart lies in the road. Nearby, an enormous troll snores loudly, surrounded by empty kegs
53. While traveling on the road, you come across a massive tree that has fallen in the middle of the road. It will take 1d10 hours to clear. Unbeknownst to the party, a massive ogre is hiding in a nearby cliff waiting for an unsuspecting caravan to wander into his tree trap.
54. High above, two perytons are watching the road for fresh hearts they can consume before laying their eggs. They circle at an altitude where they are easily mistaken for eagles. Each character can make a DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check upon seeing the creatures. Success means they recognize the perytons for what they are before the first dive attack. Failure means the character is surprised.
55. Blood Moon: The sky turns a deep red, and 2D6 undead rise from the ground. This involves skeletons, crawling\_claws, zombies, orc\_zombies.
56. A dog runs into the party begging for food and wanting to play if feed will stay with them till the danger
57. A dragon flies overhead. It seems that it did not spot you. Lucky.
58. A majestic elk sprint past with something golden caught in its antlers. If chased (half a day)
59. A pack of wolves is heard howling at the moon nearby, a few minutes later they are heard much farther away.
60. The players have food poising from the night before and spend the morning sick. (half of a day)
61. Quicksand
62. A snake is found coiled near the camp. If approached it slithers quickly away leaving a nest of 2d4+2  red eggs. They act as a healing potion if added to food.
63. You spot some glowing mushrooms
64. Swarm Of Insects
65. tar pit
66. The undergrowth is thick confining you to a narrow path. It switched sharply left then right…. to a dead end. (half a day)
67. The part may come upon a beehive. Do they wish to try to get some honey?
68. A party member trips on a hidden rock. As they are falling, they feel as though they are being ‘caught’ before hitting the ground. A nearby ent uses its vines to catch the player before they hurt themselves.
69. As the party approaches, they see a fawn, a rabbit, and a skunk run off to hide in the bushes.
70. A white stag/any other big game animal crosses the road and bolts. Do the adventurers pass on this trophy that could be worth money for its pelt/antlers/alchemical ingredients or do they go hunting?
71. A vicious squirrel begins throwing nuts and chattering at the party. It doesn’t do any real damage, but it is painful and annoying.
72. An iceburg with a magic item of frost frozen at the center.
73. A shimmering pond in an oak grove known for making anyone who drinks from it lucky for three days.
74. A sleeping stone giant covered in pine trees.
75. An area where nothing grows, not even druid magic can grow plant life there.
76. A strange circle of stones.
77. Stones laid out like an arrow, or maybe a big X.
78. A large herd of owlbear asleep in a berry patch. Blue stains cover their beaks and they cannot be easily roused (location likely under fey influence).
79. A fairy ring which the locals say becomes an entryway to the Feywild once in a blue moon and to the Shadowfell every thirteenth blue moon.
80. Blue moon
81. The slimy tracks of a giant snail. If followed, the creature is encountered trying to devour a humongous mushroom. Who knows what kind of treasure it might have swallowed.
82. A pond that reflects a different area of the woods you are in. If you jump in, you arrive in a different pond. The fish and the wild in the pond do not seem to be affected.
83. The corpse of a giant that has a tree growing through its chest.
84. A man in all green plate armor meditating infront of a pine tree. The man has slightly green skin and grass green hair. Upon trying to wake him, your vision wavers for a moment and the man is now a skeleton with plant life growing all over and in it.
85. After two days and nights of rain, lightning, and strange whistling sounds on the wind, characters awaken to see that the surrounding countryside is blanketed with fungus. It grows everywhere, including on the road. When anyone steps on a mushroom (it's nearly impossible not to), it emits a puff of black spores and a moan of pain. These tiny shriekers sprout from an immense mycelium that has spread beneath the area from shallow caves. They can be identified with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check, but if the roll is 10–14, the character misidentifies them and believes they are deadly poisonous (they aren't). The mushrooms are growing so fast on the rain-soaked ground that a person can almost see them getting bigger. They were the size of champagne corks when first noticed; within an hour, they grow six inches tall, and a foot tall an hour later. Their growth slows down after that. Anyone can literally sweep a path through the mushrooms with a heavy broom, a scythe, or a tree branch. The noise is distressing. Everyone involved in this process must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. Failure means the character is overcome with feelings of grief and remorse, seemingly triggered by hearing thousands of tiny cries of pain and death groans but which is in fact the result of inhaling mildly toxic spores released by the immature fungi. Affected characters break down after 1d20 minutes and simply can't face those sounds anymore. They have nightmares for days to come, until the toxin is completely out of their system. You can impose even more lingering results if you like, such as a lifelong aversion to eating mushrooms of any kind.
86. Just ahead of you, you find a herd of deer. As you get closer, in the center, you find a golden stag with platinum antlers. All the deer run. To chase the stag DC 10 survival every 500 yeards with DC 18 to hit the animal of 20hp. If killed, the local farmers will form a mob and confront the party with pitchforks. The mob whats compensation for their now dead lucky dear.
87. Allergens are particularly bad this night, roll CON or wake up in coughing, sneezing red-eyed fit. Disadvantage of perception for the following day.
88. The fire dies out. It is pitch dark. (get more wood? perhaps leads to something interesting happening, you could reroll on this table to determine what happens while you search for firewood).
89. The guard of the camp starts to nod off. Roll CON to stay awake
90. The night has been particularly dry, you wake up with cracked, bleeding lips and a dry thirst.
91. The night has been particularly hot and humid, all PC’s that can sweat wake up sticky and smelly.
92. The night has been particularly wet, the PC’s clothes are now all sodden with cold mud.
93. A PC has a nightmare and wakes up screaming.
94. Random PC awakes to find a trinket beneath their backpack (roll from trinket list).
95. Restless night. Do not gain any benefits from the long rest. roll to determine a party member which this happens to.
96. Someone notices eyes glittering in the dark at them. Anyone with darkvision can make out an unidentifiable shape. It runs off before you can shine your light on it.
97. Spider/scorpion/rodent crawled into a player’s boot. Do a perception check before putting boots on unless they knock the boots out first.
98. Succubus appears to the player and offers a great time with no strings attached. If the player agrees, she gleefully pulls out a chessboard and asks if they want to be the white or black pieces.
99. When your players awake in the morning after a restless night of camping, they discover footprints all around them in the dirt. Their backpacks have been looked through, but nothing has been stolen. This happens a few more nights in a row.
100. You find a pseudo-dragon rummaging around the group's treasury if questioned he’ll claim to be a real dragon cursed with being very, very small.
101. You get a night of restful sleep and restore one additional hit die in the morning.
102. You get really hungry. Tomorrow’s rations are looking delicious.
103. You over-sleep by 2d4  hours.
104. When the party reaches its stopping point for the night, two buxom twin sisters are there ahead of them, setting up camp and tending to their horses. Arietta and Zelina Innevar take a liking to someone each. They spend the evening asking about their past, where they're headed, whether they have family, and so on. The sisters are actually two doppelgangers. They can either attack someone that night or join the party for a few days.  While they travel, they study the player and choose their victims. When the time comes to strike, they wait until after dark, then try to lure their target away from other people by calling for assistance in a familiar voice. Fortunately for the characters and their fellow travelers, if one is defeated, the other flees in a flurry of curses and vengeful threats.
105. The party sees a fight happening ahead. A freight wagon is stranded on the road, it's draft animals dead. A merchant (noble) and three guards are sheltered under the cart, with crates dragged between the wheels for cover. They are plentifully supplied with crossbows and bolts, but the six hobgoblins and one hobgoblin captain assailing them seem content to keep them under siege until sundown. They plan to rush the wagon with darkness as cover. These are Urshani hobgoblins, recognizable by their unusually savage appearance (even for hobgoblins). Urshani hobgoblins adorn themselves with wolf furs, paint worg heads onto their shields, and incorporate other wolf parts and icons in their armor and clothing. First, the hobgoblins must be driven off, then the injured attended to. Next, something must be done about the stranded wagon. The trader has money to buy more horses if anyone is willing to sell. Otherwise, he'll take a lift to the next hostelry, where he can buy animals, while his three guards stay behind.
106. You hear the cry of a bird overhead. It looks like someone cast a fireball. As it, flies over it drops a feather that floats down to the ground. It emits like the spell creates bonfire.
107. You come upon a fork in the road. One path reads “whoever rides down this path will know hunger and cold” the second reads “whoever rides down this path their mounts will die but they will live”, and the last path reads who ever rides down this path will die but your mounts will live.
108. At dawn, the white rider passed; at or before noon, the red. As the black rider rode past.
109. You come upon a house in the middle of the woods. The gate around is made of humanoid bones and the house stands on chicken legs. Do you dare enter?"

3. Originally named hobbits, the halflings renamed themselves due to extraplanar lawyers, known as Aeons, challenging their right to the name in 1976.

4. From the Dwarven word hauflin, meaning an awkward rustic teenager, who is neither man nor boy, and so half of both.

1. Specially constructed dungeon made to entertain onlookers
2. A Very literal Murder Mystery
3. Just take a real world sport and make it more deadly
4. A Reality TV Show where someone is killed off each episode
5. Good old fashioned Battle Royale"

The more setting-neutral the better.

78. A dog starts following the party. It trots along, gleefully pushing his muzzle into the palm of the closest party member when you temporarily stop. They will follow you beyond the city wall. If anyone makes an effort to bond with them, they will help keep guard during the night in exchange for your love and protection. \/_solounwnmas\]
79. A kitty crosses the street. \/Kni7es\]
80. Whilst leaving a small hamlet, you spot a small child (8-10 yrs) standing right next to a field, apparently trying to catch something. If the players go closer, they see them trying to catch something that looks like bugs. If they ask the child what they are doing, they will tell them  the local farmer pays children 1cp per 25 bugs caught on his fields, if brought to him. The players may help them; if they do, they'll have to roll a Dex check to see how good they are at catching bugs. However many they catch, handing them over to the child will reward them with big happy child eyes and maybe a joyous cheer, as they celebrate that they may be able to buy some sweets from the local bakery now. \/Kloetee\]

2. Middle-Class Birth: You were born to the middle class, which includes merchants, artisans, and tradespeople. You likely grew up in a good-sized settlement, and one of your parents is likely associated with a guild or other trade organization. As a free person, you don't experience the bondage of serfdom or peasantry, but you also lack the privilege of the nobility.

24. Separated Twin: You were born with another beside you in the womb, but now you don't know what has become of them or if you will ever meet. Maybe there is still hope.
25. Folk Tale Birth: Your parents used to tell you that they found you in a cabbage patch, or that you were delivered by a stork. Turns out, they weren't lying.
26. Forged: Your parents (or parent) molded you from clay or carved you from wood/stone and, through some arcane ritual, imbued you with life beyond that of a construct.
27. Grown: An experiment of alchemy and fleshcrafting, your creator grew you in a massive vat just to see if they could.
28. Shooting Star: Your parents saw a shooting star and wished they could have a child. The star then veered off course, coming plummeting through their window. Sitting in the broken glass, smoking after ripping through the atmosphere, was you.

294,"In my homebrew dnd campaign, the party just wandered into a city where a majority of the people can talk telepathically and move objects around with their minds. Let's build d100 encounters in psychic city.

2. Psychic construction workers are moving a heavy steel beam with their powers. One of the workers got distracted and dropped mental control over the beam

5. The intense psychic energy are causing dream and/ or nightmares to come to life

17. The longer they spend in the city, the party begins to experience mild abilities similar to the native residents. As soon as they step out of town it's lost. For lower wisdom score characters this can cause discomfort, sleeplessness, and if not addressed madness. (**CIABrainBugs)**
18. The library has no books but rather sets of crytals that contain the entire thoughts of authors. The process of creating these is almost like a lobotomy leaving the author with only the parts of their mind to keep them upright, breathing and walking around.

24. There is a piece of information the party needs, the only place they can get it is the mind palace of a comatose wizard. Time for a brain heist! (**Toomeytime7896**\*\*)\*\*
25. A gang of delinquent disembodied consciousnesses are telekinetically floating around town committing general acts of hooliganry; smashing mailboxes with their minds, loitering in other peoples thoughts, spray-painting dicks on the fabrics of space-time, really annoying stuff. If only someone could find where they stashed their unoccupied bodies and “straighten them out” a little…  (**Still\_Maverick\_Titan)**
26.  Someone tries to communicate with the MCs but the players can't understand because the images they are being sent don't make sense to them. (**ThePyreOfHell)**

296,"I want to have a gnomish city filled with simple clockwork constructs (kinda like the star wars droids), but I don't want acronym names or a series of numbers for each one. What are some fun, whimsical names for constructs gnomes would have? Bonus points if they can swim, the city is built in underwater brass tubes and bubbles, Bioshock style. 

1. Sea Spider. This simple automaton doubles as a vehicle. It allows one medium or two small creatures to walk along the ocean floor. 

2. Brass Sentry. This clockwork guard bears a halberd. Where a head would be is a large glass cylinder with a green light inside. When it detects lawbreakers, the green light turns red and it releases a loud alarm sound. 

3. Scouterfish. These small mechanical fish have a large glass eye which doubles as a flashlight. They patrol the waters and look for intruders, dangers, or anything else of interest. Gnomes can see through the eye via a series of glass spheres inside, and can even take remote control of them when necessary. 

4. The Whale. This massive brass whale is the gnomish city's final security measure, released in times of danger. 

5. Handyman. These robots are arrayed with an assortment of tools and supplies, and are dispatched to repair any damages to the city or other constructs."
297,"I’m running an all vampire party and want to make some stuff they can debunk about vampires. (Can include statements of someone debunking it)

***


1. All blood tastes the same.

2. All vampires are rich

3. Only men are vampires (damn sexism!)

4. You can’t be be born as a vampire

5. All vampires are old

6. All vampires are goth

7. Vampire Women are very thirsty, not necessarily for blood 

8. Vampires can teleport (No, they just are fast)

9. Vampires love meat juices that come from the pan after they cook (They don't. That's not blood), (Thank you for including that not all of us like it raw, I actually prefer a good flambé for humans)

10. Vampires hate pets. (They love pets, except humans are also on the list, just as people may have a pet chicken, they might have a human pet.), (They’re most likely errand runners, **most** of us aren’t kinky.)

11. Vampires will never take blood from a dead person. (Of course they won't! Ever heard of rigor mortis? Yuck.), (Plus, that’s just kicking a dead horse, no vampire in their right mind would even think about it..)

12. Vampires are all serial killers (Why would they be? Attention? Too much blood they don't need? Only the hungriest bloodstarved ones would recur to that. Only giving trouble to the others who will have to either eliminate that one or cover it up), (Yeah, okay humans. You all are acting like you don’t have Ted Bundy, that clown guy, uh.. I don’t know, I’m not up to date on this.)

13. Vampires love wine.

14. Vampires will always have a coffin to sleep (Do you know how much a really durable coffin would cost? Not cheap! And very suspicious!), (And wood rot is terrible! You have to buy one every thousand years! Terrible)

15. Vampires breed humans for consumption.

16. Vampires are actually the owners of all blood banks. (The wealthiest or older ones might own one or two, and these are not abundant.), (Hah! We wish we did, but you should hand them over, it’s not like you need them.)

17. Vampires hate taking photos.

18. Vampires are actually aliens. (You really think they would stay in a planet full of garlic and churches?), (Wait.. Humans actually believe this?? I should definitely go tell them, politely, with no violence involved)

19. Vampires have a preference to virgin blood. (Ew, this is really disgusting and weird, please stop)

20. Vampires hate Japan.

21. A vampire's most mortal enemy is a werewolf. (They are tough but, with proper planning, not invincible.)

22. Vampires will never use weapons. (Sure they will, ever heard of this guy called Vlad Teles? However most probably won't need them.)

23. Vampires are weak to Silver. (A lot of them even have a Silver cup just to joke on that. No holy water though, that thing burns and burns good.), (Now, I always thought that was a werewolf thing.. I guess not)

24. Vampires can smell fear. (Everyone can if the victim pee their pants.), (I feel that would be a bit useless, like why would you need that?)

25. Vampires are all very pretty. (Ever heard of the nosferatu clan?)

26. Vampires will light on fire if they enter a church. (A place full of holy water can definitely seem like they are burning, but it's more of a chemical reaction than a real flame)

27. Vampires are all devil's pawns (There might be a few but they are just the more dramatic ones), (I use it to scare humans when I’m bored, so I get where they’re coming from)

28. A vampire's bite will always kill the victim. (Only if the vampire sucks too much, after all that could be the chance to turn the victim into someone from your clan. Also voluntary blood giving, why kill when you could be able to keep it.)

29. Vampires do not bleed. (Really? Blood eating creatures wouldn't bleed? Seriously?)

30. Vampires are immortal. (Without blood they can definitely die if for some reason they deny their bloodthirst. Although they don't have an apparent determined life span older ones might be killed by the younger ones so that they can rise to power. Humans and werewolves have also been known to very rarely join forces to kill vampires.), (Yes, while we are considered immortal, it’s usually because we’ve already died. We just kind of become ashes if you somehow make it to the end)

31. Vampires will never want to draw attention for themselves.

32. Vampires will never. Ever. Break a promise. (Older ones most likely won't. With age comes wisdom and to make a promise means to have a commitment for either their very long lives or until the one whom they made a promise to die.)

(7-32 credited to)

33. Vampires need to be invited into a domicile to enter.(We don’t, it’s just good manners you filthy peasant.) -

34. All Vampires own castles. (Well sure the rich old ones, not us young bloods)

35. Vampires have no self-control around fresh blood.

36.  Vampires can't cross running water. (one priest blesses a river into holy water and everyone thinks they are safe), (Maybe If you had a shaman calling down your rain everyday, but otherwise water is water.)

37. Vampire wear leather (leather is for peasants, silk is for kings. I'll have a servant make a new shirt if it tears), (Finally, someone points it out!)

38. Vampires have a lisp (It’s not like we can’t have lisps sometimes, but it’s on the same level as human lisps.)

39. Vampire can't follow changing times

40. Nice vampires drink from farm animals (Eww gross, why? Do you know how many humans are willing and eager?), (Yes, if anything, animals are worse. They taste bad, they can’t consent..)

41. All Vampire group together in covens (What are we, witches?)

42. Vampires can only drink from the neck (And you can only eat chicken thighs?)

43. A stake through the heart kills vampires (Actually it does unless they do it to themselves, So no suicide by stick young bloods)

(34-43 credited to-Colbry)

44. Vampires create ghouls by partially infecting the living with vampirism (Ghouls are basically just zombies that any necromancer can rise)

45. Vampires can transform into bats at will (It’s actually a widespread sect of vampire druids that do this, but it doesn't come with being a vampire naturally)

46. Vampires burn in sunlight (It feels like burning to them, but actually the sunlight just causes a biochemical reaction to their mutation that hurts- they don't necessarily turn into ashes. More like caustic chemicals and it only hurts the skin)

47. Vampires Are Repelled by religious symbols (Actually only by one specific deities' symbol and it's because their specific order mass-slaughtered vampires in the past. It is not a magical effect, they just get so mad and sad about the many losses that they choke up for a second everytime someone reminds them of that order.)

48. Vampires like to prey on beautiful women (They prefer to prey on any person who actually washes themselves, which happens to lead to an overall more healthy outwards appearance. They do not focus the one bright maiden, they just try to avoid the peasants that don't bathe- same reason with the garlic)

43. The party encounters a statue that disappears when they turn their backs on it. For the rest of their time in the dungeon they hear the sound if scraping stone following them.
44. A room filled with standing skeletal figures in the richest of formal wardrobes, as if they were dancing at the King’s formal ball. As the PCs look at them, eerie music plays from nowhere and the skeletons begin to dance again. (Paganini’s 3rd Caprice works great for this scene).
45.  Water that when disturbed, ghostly hands emerge grasping; dex save or suffer chill damage. Goes well with rocks you can use to jump over the water, or to make players choose ghost water or long way round.

9. A rival necromancer to the one in option (5). This one is also building a tower of bone, but is in a race, and accidentally forgot a way to get back *down*. He's almost half a kilometer up at this point, and is starting to wonder if he should learn the Fly spell sooner or wait till later. ( [**Xavius\_Night**]( )
10. And entire family clan of gnomes. They found the tower a long time ago, and just moved in, and now it's full to bursting with gnomes. Gnomish tinkers, gnomish fighters, gnomish cooks, gnomish barbers, gnomish cartographers, gnomish mothers, gnomish children, and every other sort of gnomish folk you can imagine, and they've even expanded it downwards pretty far.  ( [**Xavius\_Night**]( )
11. A single cow, much too large to have fit through the ladder-hatch to get up there. There is nothing magical or anomalous about it, and nobody has any clue how it got there or how it's still doing just fine. Once removed from the tower, it will need to eat and sleep as normal, but the tower has kept it safe and sustained the time that it has been up there.  ( [**Xavius\_Night**]( )
12. A dragon, currently held captive by an evil princess who is slaying anyone that tries to rescue the poor dragon. The princess is, in truth, an Archfey in disguise, and plenty powerful enough to beat the heck out of any adventuring party that messes with her. The dragon lost a bet.  ( [**Xavius\_Night**]( )
13. A princess and a dragon, playing a game of cards. The princess has her title and her crown and her clothes, but that's it - the kingdom she was princess of has broken apart recently, and wasn't very prosperous to begin with. The dragon was kind enough to let her live in their tower for the time being.  ( [**Xavius\_Night**]( )
14. A werebeast astronomer, who is trying to figure out what part, exactly, of moonlight makes them transform. It's very slow going, because they aren't exactly in their right mind when it comes time to take notes, and their lab assistants keep running away.  ( [**Xavius\_Night**]( )
15. A completely average wizard, who inherited the tower from his great, great, great, great, *great* grandfather, who finally died of old age when he forgot his daily application of anti-aging spells. He has absolutely *no* idea of how to decipher *any* of the mess of scribbles that are supposedly the secrets to spells of eternal life. In truth, the previous wizard had simply memorized the spell formula and never got around to writing it down. The scribbles are just reminders about groceries.  ( [**Xavius\_Night**]( )
16. Three dozen pigeons and their keeper. She isn't remarkable in any way, and the pigeons are not special either. She just thinks they're adorable.  ( [**Xavius\_Night**]( )
17. A *very* lost Celestial Being, who is trying to figure out where the heck they teleported to after the party *this time*.  ( [**Xavius\_Night**]( )
18. A previous campaign's BBEG, trying to hide so he can retire. Will bribe the party with 'OP items' to make them leave, and then teleport the tower elsewhere so they can't come back when they realize he basically tricked them with magical children's toys.  ( [**Xavius\_Night**]( )
19. An entire ocean, complete with a near shore. The tower is actually a permanent passage to a lovely demiplane, and the demiplane's owner will welcome anyone who wants to come in and enjoy the waves - he's a surfer bro wizard, but he likes company.  ( [**Xavius\_Night**]( )
20. The party, but descending from another timeline. Make it very awkward, GM.  ( [**Xavius\_Night**]( )
21. A Banshee that was killed long ago as part of a cult's dark ritual. The Banshee's soul was locked to an isolated tower by a wizard that deemed her almost omniscient knowledge too dangerous.  ( [**KakarotoCm**]( )
22. A monk, who wishes to teach his unique style of martial arts to any who can demonstrate mastery of their own. If a satisfactory demonstration is made, the monk strikes the player and imparts the knowledge. But after great wings spring from his back and horn's sprout from his skull and he warns that now they know Devil's Fist and the celestial martial arts masters will be hunting them. ( [**SinisterOculus**](
23.  A nobleman has a wager to live in the isolated tower for a year. He is slowly going mad with cabin fever. ( [**sirkibblesnbits**]( )
24. A world-renowned architect and builder is on a mission to build the world's tallest tower. He is close to success, but is coming across some unforeseen problems. ([**NecessaryCornflake7**](
25. A business man refuses to buy additional land, but continues to expand his business and trade capabilities by building up and this tower is a result of that. His team is getting really good at using pulleys and crane devices.  ([**NecessaryCornflake7**](
26. A leader from a religion wanted to get as close as he could to his god so he could hear from them better. You could say it was successful with this very tall temple.  ([**NecessaryCornflake7**](
27. This tower shares itself with another tower across the river. It was intended to build a bridge between the two, but the distance was too great and the designer didn't take into account factors like these and it is completely abandoned from that initial effort. It's used as a scouting function now.  ([**NecessaryCornflake7**](
28. ..."

25. All food in the area sours. Wine is vinegar, grains rot and the village has been surviving off cottage cheese for some time. (/2nd_favorite_son)

26. All farm animals of gained sentience and are unionized. An imp is mobilizing the animals to create enough chaos and riots to get people to ask the devil for a deal. (/2nd_favorite_son)

27. An earth elemental has awakened in the town square. It has a religious artifact on its body. It walks around not directly harming people but shakes the ground and rubs against buildings. People want it gone but holy men/women see it as a great sign. They stop the guard and follow it constantly, worshipping it. (/2nd_favorite_son)

28. A construct that the local artificer was working on has gone berserk. It has smashed many of the buildings and people. It is still rampaging through the town looking for targets. (/World_of_Ideas)

45. A wizard has cursed the population so that every single person sees everyone else they talk to as an evil mirror of themself. (/Brofromtheabyss)

46. The animals and the humans have all mind-swapped at random. There are humans trapped in the bodies of birds, bugs, cows, etc. Judging by one naked old man who keeps flapping his arms, roaring and blowing air at you then being surprised when you don’t die, someone has mind swapped with a dragon. (/Brofromtheabyss)

47. The village has become enchanted by a group of fey folk so that the dreams of everyone in town manifest physically in the town itself. Buildings are warped, people find themselves pursued by partially formed versions of those who they lust after, (fake) gold coins (painfully) rain from the heavens, holes to nowhere appear out of nowhere. There are doors people are afraid to enter but nobody knows why, etc. (/Brofromtheabyss)

48. Where the town once stood is a massive sphere of raw chaos and sound. A wizard botched a levitation spell and now the four fundamental forces (gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force and strong nuclear force) have been reversed fundamentally destroying/changing everyone and everything inside down to the subatomic level. Is there a way to survive within this realm? What secrets does it hold? Either way, The bubble seems to be slowly expanding. (/Brofromtheabyss)

49. The town and its inhabitants seem OK, but are all actually stuck in a time loop, where everyone and everything inside resets each dawn, with locals all waking up in bed with vivid ""dreams"" of previous days' actions. Anyone and anything else caught in the town's limits at sunrise are similarly trapped, with new rooms and buildings being magically created to house them. (/SomeAnonymous)

50. Everyone in the town is cursed to be filled with an insatiable urge to destroy some particular type of thing/person, and at night they band together into torch-and-pitchfork mobs to roam the local countryside in search of whatever their particular hatred is. (/SomeAnonymous)

51. A prosperous town was poisoned by the strange words of an unknown advisor of mysterious origins, becoming paranoid and mistrustful of the outside world. Fate varies depending on goal — could be filled with hubristic and violent NPCs or nothing but ghostly whispers corrupting people who stay too long. (/SomeAnonymous)

52. A preacher for a cult passed through the town, convincing many of the townsfolk to engage in horrible, odious acts, culminating in a large chunk of the people dying/being corrupted into nightmarish apparitions. (/SomeAnonymous)

53. Geological activity under the town created a large number of sinkholes and vents spewing hot gases, which destroyed many buildings, and poisoned the air for everyone who survived.(/SomeAnonymous)

54. An affronted druid took revenge on a polluting, industrial town by making every piece of worked metal in the area {into sand, cursed, attack their owners, sentient and malicious, into living trees/animals/fungi}, and now most people have left or died. (/SomeAnonymous)

55. Giant, clockwork engines erupted from the ground one day, tearing buildings and roads apart, and crushing people wherever they were in the way. (/SomeAnonymous)

56. An extradimensional insectoid species has established a gargantuan colony under the town. Pheromones released by the Queen into the drinking supply have turned the townspeople into mind-slaves of the queens with the sole ambition of keeping the hive secret until it is ready to expand. Only the town drunk has avoided the water and the pheromone which is destroyed by ethyl alcohol, although nobody but the Queen knows this. (/Brofromtheabyss)

57. A vampire has invaded the town, stealing all of their gold by tricking the villagers into exchanging it for what he/she calls a “Bit Coin” Villagers can buy the “Bit Coin” from him/her and supposedly give it back to the vampire instead of being bitten. Of course, the vampire bites them anyway, but after they’re bitten they claim they haven’t been and we’re saved by “bit coin” (/Brofromtheabyss)

58. A local inventor discovered a very sensitive and potent touch explosive, but not how to stabilize it. Pixies were secretly watching and learned how to copy the formula. Chaos has ensued ever since, from doors exploding if you slam them too hard to shoes exploding when a villager starts to run. Lately potatoes have been exploding when dug out of the ground and tossed into the basket. The pixies find this hilarious and it would be, if people didn’t keep dying and losing limbs. (/Brofromtheabyss)

59. A well intentioned wizard discovered the secret to an area-based immortality spell and shared it with the village. Unfortunately immortality does not mean eternal health and a horrifying Bacterial plague hit soon after. Now the bacteria are immortal too, and the now mostly abandoned town is so full of immortal, eternally dividing bacteria that it can literally be seen by the naked eye piled up in corners and blowing in the wind. There are a few insane and pestilential immortals who would rather stay than leave the area to die as well. (/Brofromtheabyss)

60. While the rest of the area is in a famine, this town is mysteriously verdant and full of food of all kinds, and the villagers are warm and welcoming. Unfortunately, this is due to them needing to lure unsuspecting travellers to use as sacrifices to a demon who promises good harvest as long as it is appeased. Anyone with true-seeing can see all the “harvest” are piles of organs, bone and flesh. Corn cobs are forearms studded with human teeth, the pumpkins are heads, eggs are testicles and eyes, potatoes are kidneys, and the carrots are shin bones. The livestock are mutilated sacrifices stripped of the ability to speak or walk on two legs. The villagers are totally ignorant of this and believe the food to be as it appears. (/Brofromtheabyss)"

302,"Everyone likes to think they'd own a spaceship in a big spacefaring age, but maintaining a whole spaceship is really expensive and kinda turns into your whole job. Instead, you'd probably be one of the passengers like in a cruise ship or a train. Here are 1d100 people you can1. The unlikely parents - These two inconspicuous parents are actually from two groups that hate eachother; rival religious groups, countries that are at war, races, etc. They have a kid. Needless to say, both of the groups are after them, and their disguise sucks.

1. The unlikely parents - These two inconspicuous parents are actually from two groups that hate eachother; rival religious groups, countries that are at war, races, etc. They have a kid. Needless to say, both of the groups are after them, and their disguise sucks.

2. The old cowboy - A grizzled bounty hunter who kinda looks and speaks like a cowboy, going to find some prey at the destination. May be looking for enterprising and trustworthy folks who can provide some hands and guns, now that his own aren't what they used to be. May also stab them in the back at a pivotal moment.

3. The reporter - A nervous reporter who's in possession of a big break; a huge piece of news that will put a big ol' target on their back. Little do they know that there's already someone ready to shut them up before they reach the destination.

4. The gourmand - A foodie touring the universe to experience as much of culinary as they can. Can point you to some of the best restaurants in the destination.

5. The knight - A space knight or crusader of some sort, devoted to a very strict religion and code of conduct. Going to contact the local chapter in the destination to train under that master.

6. The renegade - A former space knight who left that life behind and now drift among the stars. Is looking for someone who took something important from them (their spouse, their former life, their reputation, their parents, their dog, etc) and believes they're in the destination.

7. The man in the suit - A man dressed well. Speaks little, listens less. Is actually an agent from a big faction looking for a whistleblower or refugee of some sort, and his latest lead points to the destination. If the Reporter is aboard, the Man in the Suit will be looking for them.

8. The nosy one - Someone who cannot for the life of them stay out of your business. They keep appearing to be irritating and seems to always be around. Not a big deal if you're just travelling, but will make life harder if you're trying to be secretive about something - and will gossip about you if you do anything suspect (they'll do it even if you don't, actually).

9. The artist - Some sort of painter, writer, musician, digital artist, whatever, who's going to the destination to compose a piece inspired by it. Has ties with the industry. Can put you in their work if you're interesting enough.

10. The mother - A single mother without a father in sight. She'll give birth in the middle of the trip and it'll either be a bad distraction, or a strange surprise for the player, depending on whether they decide to help deliver the baby or not.

11. The rowdy ruffian - Either by nature or because of some kind of vice, this person is aggressive and will provoke at least one fight over the length of the trip.

12. The uncertain terrorist - A young person with a suitcase. They agreed to do some sort of terrorist attack upon arrival, but is either getting cold feet or fearing it won't work. The suitcase is filled with either (1d6) 1. explosives, 2. a bioweapon, 3. a software virus, 4. an ecological weapon who will change the weather of the place, 5. nothing, they got duped, or 6. a defective weapon that'll fail and kill or injure them.

13. The diplomat - Someone on a diplomatic mission to the destination. Is very busy but very well-connected. May be a harbinger of changes to the status quo, or just someone who really knows their news.

14. The dog - Who let this thing in? Well we can't just jettison the poor bastard into space, can we!? Maybe one of the passengers will want it.

15. The bright-eyed kid - A bright-eyed young person with a polite demeanor and well dressed but not very wealthy appearance. They say they're very wealthy on their mother's side, but they haven't seen them in a long time (aka since they were born) and they're going to the destination in the hopes of finding them and reconnecting.

16. The refugee - A single father with his kid. Got enough money to flee the mining colonies in the asteroid belt, thinks the destination will provide a good life for him and his kid. Will keep hitchhiking through space until he finds such place.

17. The party - A bunch of passengers who are celebrating something through the entire voyage. Can be very noisy and aggravating, or good revellers and jolly companions. Will drink you under the table. There's a chance (maybe 2 in 6) that one of them is actually a really important person, like the son of a politician, an officer, a big name scientist, etc.

18. The fortune teller - A strange person who keeps brooding around. Will offer to read your palm. Ask a question and roll a 1d6 - if even, they say you'll face woe or hardship, if odd, they say it'll be nice and easy. How real this actually is depends on the GM.

19. The celebrity - A famous wrestler, rockstar, game developer, or whatever you find appropriate is aboard the ship. They can either be on their prime, going to some celebrity business on the destination, or washed up and avoiding fans as much as possible.

20. The trafficker (TW: child abuse) - A smiling person with a very silent kid on their feet at all time. If you pay attention, they treat the kid really poorly and makes them do menial tasks like a servant. In truth, the kid is their merchandise that they're taking to a patron on the destination.

21. The businessman - he's traveling to make the arrangements for an incredibly lucrative investment by some very exclusive top money. He's not at liberty to share their names, but if he could, you'd certainly be impressed. Obviously, this kind of opportunity isn't available to just anybody. Oh, all right, since he can tell that you're an exceptionally discerning group, he might be persuaded to let you buy into this astonishing opportunity, too. [/gnurdette]

22. The performer: She's won the top planetwide prize in her age group, and part of the prize is a trip to the interplanetary championship. You can hear her practicing in her stateroom and she might be persuaded to practice/perform for the passengers. [/gnurdette]

23. The prodigal's parents: Their child has gotten into legal trouble off-planet. They're hoping that they can provide some kind of help in person, though they are in anguished uncertainty about whether their help will be any use. [/gnurdette]

24. The betrayed: Anguished at her infidelity, he is hoping that a brand-new life on a brand-new planet will somehow help him get her out of his head. He doesn't realize that she slipped aboard just before liftoff. [/gnurdette]

25. The liberated: She's got an amazing story of how she's returning home having escaped a ruthless interplanetary kidnapping ring. The story is really amazing... you might say unbelievable. She starts to claim that the kidnappers have secret agents among the passengers trying to re-kidnap her. [/gnurdette]

26. The researcher: Travels with a large piece of equipment that blurps and bleeps and flashes lights and uses a lot of power. Moves it around the ship taking readings. Is happy to explain to you what it's measuring and why. Nobody will be able to make any sense of the explanation. ""That WAS in layman's terms!"" [/gnurdette]

27. The amnesiac - a strange person in that they don't know or have forgotten why they are here or how they got there but they are relying on that getting there will jog their memory [/Emotional_Guillotine]

28. The Fatal familial insomniac - somebody who hasn't slept in months, to years at worst you would be seeing them as they have started to except their death. Or is within one of the other 4 stages [/Emotional_Guillotine]

29. The helper: Is convinced that the point of life is to do acts of kindness for others. Wanders the ship looking for people who could use a hand with anything. Kind of gets underfoot. [/gnurdette]

30. The wannabe: An adolescent who really wants to be a spacer. Follows crew around asking them to describe their job and everything about the ship, and pleading to be allowed to help. At their family's destination, they'll try to sneak back aboard, hoping to make a stowaway-to-crew transition. [/gnurdette]

31. The bucket-lister: Has been diagnosed with six months to live. This trip is one of those things they really want to do before they die. Oh, and you know what else they've always wanted to do, just once? Take a spacewalk. And pilot a ship. And fire the torpedoes.Plot twist: is the diagnosis even real? [/gnurdette]

32. The cosmophobe: Is terrified of space travel. Averts their eyes from portholes, mumbles ""it's just a ship on the ocean, it's a ship on the ocean"" trying to soothe themselves. Begs you not to say anything reminding them that you're all in space. [/gnurdette]

33. The self-study expert: Has read a lot about spaceships and is quite certain that this is all wrong and you're doing everything wrong. [/gnurdette]

34. The guru: Is leading a small group on a wellness expedition to seek healing through diet, lifestyle, and mindfulness. They take set up meditation and exercise areas in the public spaces. They freely dispense earnest physical and mental health advice. [/gnurdette]

35. The gun bunny: Loves to talk about armed and unarmed combat. Has firm opinions on it all. Lovingly describes all the weaponry they own, and has it with them if allowed (and maybe if it isn't allowed.) If any combat occurs, will freeze in useless terror. [/gnurdette]

36. The zookeeper: Travels with a variety of exotic pets and is constantly teaching them new tricks. [/gnurdette]

37. Grandma: You remind her so much of her grandchild. Attaches herself to you and natters on endlessly. Bakes some wonderful cookies, though. [/gnurdette]

38. The retiree: Used to crew an earlier model of this very ship, back in the day. Can't believe the systems that have been automated that she used to have to do by hand, every time. Will tell you all about it. [/gnurdette]

39. The Former Captain: Appalled at the slippage in standards, compared to when THEY served and lets everyone know it, (despite the fact that this is a civilian, commercial vessel and is not in the military) except for the skills of the Bartender, they get a pass because they too served, lost two limbs while touring, and slip them a pour of the real-stuff whenever they ask-- none of this weak synthahol bullshit. [/MaxSizeIs]

40. The Bartender: Secretly serve(d) in the intellegence branch, lost two limbs to a nasty ambush in a covert operation, and not actually the bartender -- well, okay they do know how to tend bar, but they aren't being paid to actually bartend -- they are instead on deep cover, and sporting high powered concealed cybernetics in the replacement limbs. They're also a great listener and pour the real stuff if they like you. They have enough operational sense not to spill the beans about thier plan, but will happily commiserate and swap declassified stories. [/MaxSizeIs]

41. The Septuplets: Transhumanists, they claim to be a vat-grown gestalt mind that creepily finish each other's sentences by pronouncing one word at a time each. They only vaguely resemble one another. They also like to pretend to be each other, swapping names, despite the gag not seeming to work well againat the observant. [/MaxSizeIs]

42. ""Doctor"": The resident hypocondriac, a child of great wealth, with enough to keep riding this ship and never leave for the last 10 years despite many many ports of call it makes. They somehow have enough of a stash of chemicals to always be dosing themselves with something. They earned thier nickname, often offering the chemicals to other passengers, ""diagnosing"" them, but never seem to get caught in any contraband sweeps. [/MaxSizeIs]

43. The Last of Their Kind: Maybe from a religion or culture long thought lost to time and entropy. Maybe they are a post-human soldier made to fight a war that ended a century ago on the other side of the galaxy; their comrades fallen in battle or succumbed to age and prejudice. Either way when they are gone, that will be a chapter of the species closed.

44. The Unwilling: They don’t want to be travelling and they certainly don’t want to get where they’re going. Only they can tell you what’s going to happen when they get there and why they’re going. [/NoManNoRiver]

45. The Scholar: Perhaps they’re lounging on a couch in the bar, wearing a fedora and leather jacket, sipping something intoxicating while they thumb through a handwritten journal. They heard rumours about some long lost artefact of great cultural significance on a far-flung world - it belongs in a museum. Or perhaps they’re travelling from seat of learning to seat of learning, trying to increase either the breadth or the depth of their knowledge. Maybe the knowledge they seek is arcane and secret, maybe they’d like to share with anyone who’ll listen. [/NoManNoRiver]

46. The Nomad: They aren’t going somewhere, they are just going. It’s about the journey for them, not the destination. Talk to them and they may tell you about it. [/NoManNoRiver]

47. The Pilgrim: They are on a great journey to show their faith, their devotion. Maybe not to a religion but to a teacher, a performer, a place, a piece of history, some technological marvel. Some on such journeys will be very open and talkative, others a little more guarded. Either way this is a huge thing for them and may even be the first time they’ve left their home village. [/NoManNoRiver]

48. The physicist - researching galaxy first hand. Trying to determine whether backwards time travel is actually possible. And maybe how to achieve it. [/Mooch07]

49. The botanist - collecting samples from as many planets as possible. [/Mooch07]

50. The lost one - From a planet that is slowly dying. One of many looking for a new home. [/Mooch07]

51. The outcast - lives and worked on an asteroid belt for years, until pay was cut and crew were let go. Probably wanted for theft. [/Mooch07]

52. The Corporate: A manager from some Megacorporation. They're constantly busy with work, and prefer to be left alone. During their 5 minute coffee break, they can be quite sociable, however only to middle-class passengers. [/snakebite262]

53. The Big, yet Bashful: This individual comes from a society where bigger is better. Thanks to advanced medicines and genetic procedures, they've swollen to a remarkably large size. However, their personality contrasts their size, as they are shy and timid. [/snakebite262]

54. The Small, but Loud: This individual comes from a society where everything is compacted and streamlined. Thanks to cybernetics and implants, they've been slimmed down to the bare essential. However, their personality contrasts their size, and they are loud and brazen. [/snakebite262]

55. The Technophile: This xenophobic individual despises anyone outside of their own culture, however they have a soft spot for cutting edge tech. Especially bots. [/snakebite262]

56. The Soldier: A citizen dressed in military uniform. They are brash and crude when talked to, and may start a fight if they get too relaxed. [/snakebite262]

57. The Eye Candy: This individual is dressed in something a little TOO revealing. When spoken to, they are flirtatious and love to complement. Wait, what happened to your wallet? [/snakebite262]

58. The Clone: This individual seems a bit....off. You can't quite place it, but you feel utterly uncomfortable around them. They are unnatural, and they seem to lack a number of social graces. [/snakebite262]

59. The Eldritch Horror: This is not a person. This is clearly not a person. Yet for some reason, everyone seems to ignore the fact that this person is not a person. [/snakebite262]

60. The Replicant: This is a robot disguised as a person. It probably won't come up, and they may even be open to discussing it (depending on the society). Regardless, roll again and use them as a ""disguise template."" NOTE: If you roll this again, they are quite clearly a robot, but don't seem to realize everyone else knows that. [/snakebite262]

61. The Musclebound: This individual is covered in bulging muscles. They are constantly fidgeting, trying to get in their next 1,000 reps. [/snakebite262]

62. The Conspiracy Theorist: This poor individual has been forced to travel due to a conspiracy to ""take them out."" Whether this conspiracy is true, or just a made of facet of their mind, is up the storyteller. [/snakebite262]

63. The Alien: They are from a race that you hardly ever see traveling. Perhaps their people are xenophobic or perhaps they just rarely leave their home world. While not hostile they may have some very exotic customs. They may also require a special breathing apparatus or environmental suit. [/World_of_Ideas]

64. The Android: A robotic AI. It is designed to resemble ""x"" race, but it is obviously robotic in nature. It is traveling to its new job or perhaps it is escaping its creators. [/World_of_Ideas]

65. The Aristocrat: A member of the ruling (family, party) on planet ""x"". They are traveling with their entourage and security staff. Their guards will prevent anyone from getting too close, unless they have official business. [/World_of_Ideas]

66. The Basket Case: This person is an emotional train wreck. Something has gone horribly wrong in their life. They can often be seen crying, sobbing, or complaining about something from their past. [/World_of_Ideas]

67. The Clones: A group of people who look exactly alike. They wear different clothing to make it easier for others to identify them. While they are all physically identical, they have very different personalities. [/World_of_Ideas]

68. The Lawman / Law Woman: An officer of the law, traveling on official business. They wont put up with any crimes in their presence. If trouble arises, they will put themselves in harms way before allowing innocents to be harmed. [/World_of_Ideas]

69. The Prisoner: They are in a prison jumpsuit and restraints. One or two guards are always with them. They are being transported to (an interrogation facility / a planet where they will be tried / a prison facility). If given the opportunity, they will try to escape. It's possible that there are other passengers on the ship, that are planning to (abduct them / aid in their escape / assassinate them). [/World_of_Ideas]

70. The Space Sick: Space travel doesn't agree with this person. They have constant bouts of nausea and dizziness. They try to stay to themselves as much as possible. Conversation seems to worsen their condition. They may truly have space sickness or they may be using it as a cover to keep people at a distance. [/World_of_Ideas]

71. The Content Creator: Space travel is the new jet setting of the far future, and this kid plus entourage just has to let you know about it through hypercomms. But they haven't been able to access the interstellar bank for about a month and they're on the last of their hard currency. If you can get them off this back water to somewhere with real connections they'll set you up! [/TheRealDarik]

72. The Madame: Space travel gets lonely, and the future is a lot more laissez fair about vices (in some systems). She travels with all inclusive professionals who double as ship security - guaranteeing stiffs have to pay. [/TheRealDarik]

73. The designer of the ship - Yes it is an anonymous design (autocorrected from old but I'm keeping it). [/nogood-usernamesleft]

74. The Spook & Company- a man in suit & sunglasses equivilant with a briefcase handcuffed to his arm flanked by two no nonsense bodyguards. None of them have anything to say to anybody. [/DavidECloveast]

75. The Soldier of Fortune- has gun, is traveling. If the players convince him to join up with them (he answers to the almighty spacedollar and nothing else) he'll stick around for 1d4+1 'deployments' before 'coming in from the cold' and heading home- at least for now. [/DavidECloveast]

76. The Obnoxious Tourist- Loud, rude, obnoxious, probably circled by ugly and undisciplined rugrats. [/DavidECloveast]

77. The Missionary- off to some far corner of the universe to spread the good news. Has some small skill in ""support"" skills like first aid and the like- a staunch pacifist. [/DavidECloveast]

78. The Amateur Detective- a prolific gumshoe of notable skill and local fame, in spite of lacking any connection to law enforcement. Either a mater of deduction, or possessing stunning empathic accuracy. Would be pleasantly surprised if there is no murder mystery on the journey. [/DavidECloveast]

79. The Enthusiast- Knows more about spacecraft than God, would be absolutely enthused to tell you all about it. Can Identify any spacecraft down to the serial number and lettered suffix at a glance, as well as all the technical data that isn't classified, with a 40% chance he knows the secret specs as well. [/DavidECloveast]

80. The ""Dutchess"" - A fancy, elderly woman traveling alone. In reality, it's actually a young girl using a holographic disguise to rob the men who try to scam the old lady. [/OwenMcCauley]

81. The Captain - A ships captain named Santiana (same as the song) with two oxidized copper legs if asked about his legs he will tell a hell of a story involving a trip to Mexico [/Emotional_Guillotine]

82. The seven sisters (like from cell dwellers black star deluxe album) - they would say they are on their way to grant a little wish [/Emotional_Guillotine]

83. The Acting Troupe – A group of actors who put on this murder mystery, where the other passengers are meant to figure out who the murderer is, the motive and the method. They board the ship in character and… “Wait, did we forget to inform the crew that we’re doing this? Hold on, this dead guy isn’t part of the troupe and he’s dead for real!” [/MyEvilTwin47]

84. The “Master of Disguise.” – A guy who wears a different disguise every time he leaves his stateroom, but everyone immediately recognizes him, and the over the top accents just makes it worse. He seems to think he’s a spy on a mission to save the day, or find an important artifact at destination. [/MyEvilTwin47]

85. The Loner – A man who keeps to himself a lot, but appears to be tailing and closely observing the “Master of Disguise.” Sometimes he writes down stuff in a notebook. If a PC tries to engage him in conversation he is polite but tries to limit himself to one word responses with as few syllables as possible. At the destination he meets with two orderlies from a mental hospital, put a straight jacket on the “Master of disguise” and take him away. [/MyEvilTwin47]

86. The Glutton: This overfed monstrosity is constantly munching and crunching in the worst possible ways. Worst yet, they leave a title wave of junk and litter in their wake. They're fairly easy to bribe though. [/snakebite262]

87. The Drunkard: A lush who has had a little too much to drink. They order as many drinks as they can, slur every word, and are FAR too cozy with other passengers. [/snakebite262]

88. The Troll: This individual has no reason to be as vile and vindictive as they are. They are cruel for cruelty sake, rude for rudeness sake, and are an utterly vile little ghoul. And worst of all, they love every minute of it. [/snakebite262]

89. The Karen: This individual refuses to believe that they're anything less than a VIP. They demand better treatment, flagrantly ignore rules, and have the potential of getting kicked off the ship in a rather ostentatious matter. [/snakebite262]

90. The Novelist. Locked away for half of the day, spends the other half peoplewatching, chatting sociably, and indulging in mildly self-destructive vices. [/onepostandbye]

91. The Former Soldier and Spouse. Still adjusting to civilian life, this veteran avoids conflict or talking about themselves. If push comes to shove, this person is a highly capable combatant. [/onepostandbye]

92. The Inheritor. This person is set to attend a funeral and deal with the complexity of their departed relative’s estate. [/onepostandbye]

93. The Wayward Grad Students. These two are on their way to a field assignment for school, and education is the last thing on their minds. This trip is about parties, fun, and getting into trouble. [/onepostandbye]

94. The Grim Professor. This older educator is possibly taking their last sabbatical from teaching, where they are not being missed. Cranky and insufferable, they are nonetheless brilliant and knowledgeable. [/onepostandbye]

95. The Corporate Specialist. This engineer has been called in to handle an unusual but uninteresting technical challenge in another facility. Bored beyond belief, this person is open to novel experiences. [/onepostandbye]

96. The Pawn: This individual is a rather normal looking individual. Dreadfully dull. However, should something happen on the trip, they'll be used as a stooge, pawn or lackey in it. [/snakebite262]

97. The Rook: This large, hulking individual is fairly quiet. Nicely dressed. And Extremely fast when running in a line. [/snakebite262]

98. The Knight: Why is this well-armored person on this ship? Is that a horse with them? [/snakebite262]

99. The Bishop: A religious individual who shouts doom and gloom on the trip. Halfway through, they disappear in a flash of light and puff of smoke. [/snakebite262]

100. The King: A person surrounded by a squadron of bodyguards, attaches, and assistants. They never speak, instead letting their associates speak for him. If their associates are cleared away, it's revealed they're actually a puppet. [/snakebite262]

# **BONUS ROUND**

101. The Queen: A glamourous Queen, dressed in the freshest fashion. They are READY for the runway. Do not underestimate their power. [/snakebite262]

102. The Barron: An eccentric old individual who tells of nigh-impossible stories. [/snakebite262]

103. The Hulk: This character is typically quite small until they are alarmed. Then they swell to massive proportions. The hulk gains massive muscle mass. [/snakebite262]

104. The Pufferfish: This character is typically quite small until they are alarmed. Then they swell to massive proportions. The pufferfish blows up like a balloon. [/snakebite262]

105. The Witch Doctor: This strange individual dressed in heavily ceremonial robes. They use their magic-like abilities with the help of dolls and strange potions. [/snakebite262]"

305,"The Monster Manual has around 300 monsters in it. Not all of them will have lairs, but many will. Some, like the **Aboleth** and the **Lich** already have Lairs and ***Lair Actions***.

But lairs are about more than just actions. They have very specific descriptors; smells, which are different for a cavern dwelling **Behir** compared to a desert dwelling **Thri-Kreen**, sounds, and habitats. Temperatures, humidity, and light levels will vary as well.

With that in mind, let’s pick 100 monsters from the manual and work up a lair for one.

I’ll start!

1. **Aarakocra** MM pg 12. “*On the Material Plane, aarakocra create aeries atop the highest mountains, especially peaks near portals to the Elemental Plane of Air.*”

**Temperature**: Cold, since it’s in the mountains, and windy. But the aerie itself if a warm nest protected from the cold.  
**Smell**: Normal birds eat seeds so aarakocra might also (*though Aeries are typically carnivorous birds of prey*.) Rancid (*old*) seeds and nuts smell like paint or alcohol.  
**Appearance**: The area should be littered with the bones and scraps of fur from small game. Gargoyles are their sworn enemies so broken stone body parts could be scattered about.  
**Sounds**: Wind, a breeze, whistling through the rocks. Being so cold, sound travels slower. Quiet, near silence. The flapping of large wings when close.

.

2. **Shambling Mound** MM pg 270. “*a shambler, trudges ponderously through bleak swamps, dismal marshes, and rain forests*”

**Temperature**: Warm, damp, humid. The air is thick and sticky. It clings to you.  
**Smell**: Compost, mulch, fresh cut grass, piles of leaves, earthy.  
**Appearance**: Lack of tall plants and small game. Lots of dead and decaying flora (*and even some fauna*). Subtle movement of the vegetation.  
**Sounds**: A subtle rustling of leaves and vines. The gurgling of digestion. A stillness in the air due to lack of life (*birds, rodents, and insects abandoned the region*).

.

3. **Minotaur** MM pg 223. “*Their brown or black fur is stained with the blood of fallen foes, and they carry the stench of death.*”

**Temperature**: Generally cool with very few areas of mild warmth from smoky torches and braziers. It’s also dark. Though Minotaur don’t have dark vision, they do have ***Labyrinthine Recall*** so they can find their way around in total darkness.  
**Smell**: The coppery scent of blood, and the stench of death.  
**Appearance**: Bloody streaks on the walls and floor. Broken bones. Deep gouges in walls or trees. Glyphs and strange cultist writings and symbols. Ceremonial animal masks.  
**Sounds**: An echoing roar. Grunts and snorts. Chanting of cultists. Screams of fear or pain. Small footsteps running away. Heavy footsteps approaching.

.

4. **Yeti** MM pg 306. “*A yeti's windborne howl sounds out across remote mountains*”

**Temperature**: Bitter cold, windy, snowy. Blizzards, deadly frost. Ice. Frozen landscape.  
**Smell**: Very little, too cold. Blood and decomposition when close.  
**Appearance**: Ice and stone. Snow. Sheer cliffs. Barren tundra. Large footprints in the snow with a long gait. Carcasses of large game like sheep, rams, elk.  
**Sounds**: Howls, both howling winds and the howling wails of the monster. Cracking ice. Rumbling avalanches.

.

5. **Black Pudding** MM pg 241. “*Oozes thrive in the dark, shunning areas of bright light and extreme temperatures.*”

**Temperature**: Moderate, average. Dim light from the occasional torch or candle gives minor warmth. The air is musty, stale, dark and damp.  
**Smell**: Mildew. Metallic, almost salty. Rust. Vinegar alcohol.  
**Appearance**: Clear surfaces devoid of dust or debris. Scraps of corroded metal. Lots of dark shadows.  
**Sounds**: Squishing, faint sloshing. Thick, viscous, oily dripping. Sliding. Crackling. Bubbling. “*splort*”

What’s your favorite monster in the manual. Post it and describe its Lair area.

Thanks!"

When the spell ends, gravity returns to normal for the wearer.

/gnurdette]

18. Invisible armor: You appear unarmored.

19. Fishscales: This coat of scale mail is surprisingly slippery on the outside. Gives a bonus for resisting grappling and oil attacks, and for squeezing through tight spaces. Does not interfere at all with swimming.

29. Ring Mail of Blinding - When an attacker makes a successful Melee Attack Roll against the wearer, the attacker must succeed on a CON 16 save or be blinded until the end of their next turn.

30. Tower Shield of Corsica - When an attacker makes a successful Melee Attack Roll against the wielder of the shield, the attacker must make a successful CON 15 save or take the damage themself instead.

43. Sticky mail (or ""disarmor""): When a hand weapon hits the armor (whether it harms the target or not), the weapon sticks.

It's weight also changes to match the size. When in box form, the armor responds differently to each command word: one word makes the box unfold into nearby unoccupied space, requiring no action, and has no effect if there is not enough empty space around it; another word makes the box unfold itself around the user's body, making them wear the armor at the end of their action, which is used by this effect, and has no effect if the user is already wearing armor.

The wearer can assimilate one controlled mimic into the armor with an action.

56. Armor of Royal Sacrifice: this steel plate armor is adorned with various gems and strands of precious metals, which are inseparable from the body of the armor. It emanates an aura of royalty and fortune. When the wearer says the command word, the armor explodes, forcing creatures within 20 ft to make a Dex saving throw.

List Complete."
307,"1. **The King's Men.** The largest and most powerful gang in the area. All other gangs must pay a tribute to them or be annihilated. Wealthy and well-armed, they are led by the enigmatic crime lord known as the King of Thieves.
2. **Bubba's Boys.** Consisting almost entirely of ogres and half-ogres, this gang is all about brute force. Their favorite tactics are extortion and armed robbery, and the locals are afraid to persecute them for fear of retaliation. Their leader is a brutish hill giant named Big Bubba.
3. **The Rum-Runners.** A particularly flamboyant gang that specializes in the production and distribution of illegal alcohol. It's members are almost always drunk, and their unending stream of cheap booze has earned them many allies amongst the common folk. The group is led by a flamboyant half-elf swashbuckler known only as ""The Captain"".
4. **Free Swords.** This gang consists of unscrupulous mercenaries frequently used as hired thugs by  corrupt nobles looking to procure more land. If the current landowner refuses to sell, the Free Swords will find a solution, often with violence. No one is safe when they have a contract, and they take pleasure in killing anyone that gets in their way.
5. **The Night Folk.** This ""gang"" is more akin to a horde of animals or savages than a true criminal organization. Extremely violent and territorial, they ritualistically mutilate themselves, and are known to gruesomely torture and cannibalize their victims. If this group has a leader, they are unknown."
308,"This is a list of examples of economic issues (regarding forms of production, supply and demand, distribution of wealth) that can be used in various settings, with the occasional adjustment.

&#x200B;

1. A realm lives up to its legendary fame with streets made of gold, precious gems ground into food condiments, knights clad in gilded armor... the thing is, precious stones and metals are so abundant that they are practically worthless here. The rulers are aware of the covetousness of outsiders, so they have very strict laws for holding wealth, all the while they are trying to find an alternative currency to stave off the crushing hyperinflation.
2. The official currency is made of incredibly flimsy material, even more so than paper money, requiring people to go through great pains to conserve their money.
3. In a particular culture, there is no such thing as upfront payments. Credit is the only option, and you have to promise something worth the value of what you want to buy. Every transaction is basically a gamble.
4. A culture has an established potlatch system. People compete in generosity, trying to one-up each other with increasingly luxurious offerings. Whoever manages to give out more to the community gets to call the major political decisions.
5. A city with no private savings - all and any wealth is confiscated into and held in a public fund. The people must present vouchers for salaries and loans, which are strictly rationed in order to avoid surpluses of money in private hands.
6. Ways of bending time and space were discovered, forever altering production and land distribution.
7. All cultures are hunter-gatherers, always moving in search of locations with an abundance of game and foraging. No farming and urbanization is to be found. Alternatively, a post-apocalyptic landscape where everyone is scrambling to sedentize again.
8. People are universally commodified, as in a twisted ""universal rights of man"" logic. Persons have a specific value they are worth, according to social status and particular conditions (e.g. left-handed people are considered to have auspicious qualities). This leads to faux-equality discourse (*""See? Even the high and mighty can be bought and sold!""*), and entails indemnities for wrongful deaths.
9. Only things with actual use value (e.g. tools, food) are accepted as payment, instead of value tokens.
10. The central government of a nation collapsed, and its currency is now virtually worthless. People scramble to find alternatives.
11. An isolated - whether phisically or politically - economy must produce all of its goods. Its territory is very resource-poor.
12. Immortal or extremely long-lived beings (maybe in combination with 6.) accrue ridiculous amounts of interest on their deposited wealth.
13. A culture draws no distinction between possession and ownership - that is, if you have something with you, you are its legitimate owner. Said culture also enforces no property laws, leading to several instances of violence.
14. Production and consumption grinds to a screeching halt in order for everyone to observe a particular tradition or ritual regarding an auspicious event, when it could least afford to do so.
15. All professions are organized in castes. Say you were born to blacksmiths, you'll die a blacksmith, and may only marry another blacksmith.
16. A world with no possible surpluses of food (no refrigeration, salt, or durable grain). Starvation is always lurking.
17. A nation is subjugated by another. The economical system of its overlords shakes its way of life - maybe to ruinous extents. Living could have been rendered unsustainable for the poor, and the once ruling classes could have been reduced to plebeians, and a long-overdue class conflict may be brewing, and the new rulers may try to exploy it.
18. Various curses - real or superstitious - permeate the forms of consumption of a particular culture (e.g. the first salary you ever earn must be completely spent in a specific activity, good or kind of good; a particular category of people is barred from ever consuming a specific good).
19. A particular commercial obligation is not fulfilled, creating a domino effect (either spontaneous or reinforced by those who have some stake in it).
20. A particular export, which an economy basically revolves around, is banned by the larger international community.
21. A world where the chains of production for even the most mundane goods have grown insanely complicated, depending on countless variables, in an incredibly tenuous balance.
22. A world where magic is tied to economic value (could serve as an in-universe explanation for consumable precious material components). Whenever magic is cast without a corresponding economic counterpart, it leads to chaotic effects. Deities or similarly powerful beings enforce the rules of this system.
23. An economy in which public utilities are privately owned. Furthermore, its users, rather than consumers, are shareholders, and the biggest shareholder gets to decide on its provision and how much they get to use its services.
24. An economy with a lottery-like consortium, with various coveted goods as prizes. The odds of winning them are equal (at least at a first glance), regardless of contribution - leading to some contesting this system. Participation in it, nevertheless, is a condition for citizenship. [Inspiration](
25. A nation must rebuild its economy following a ruinous war. Its rulers are tempted at every turn to accept help from several powerful realms and/or beings - with many strings attached.
26. Struck by economical difficulties, whether from internal or external causes, various realms turn to raiding their neighbors.
27. The rulers of a nation take a gamble on extracting a particular resource or a new development policy. It falls through - whether by intrinsical flaws or factors outside their control.
28. A world where the earliest cultures somehow figured out at the dawn of time a way to produce greater surpluses than they'll ever need. The consequent economies deal only in speculation - with those who are better able to game the system coming out on top.
29. Production of any kind of desired goods is somehow rendered impossible (maybe the know-how was lost to time, or such). The only thing left is trade of whatever has been already produced in a zero sum game.
30. A large amount of traditional hunter gatherers maintain their ways amid a sedentarized society.
31. A recently-established country struggles to collect taxes, and is trying to find a way to reverse that.
32. A decree changes the country's official currency overnight, and people are frantically trying to convert their personal reserves.
33. A society manages to officially abolish slavery. Some masters are unwilling to let go of their slaves, and try to mask the situation to evade the authorities.
34. An abrupt change renders a good obsolete, to the ruin of its producers.
35. A society uses a small rodent as it’s primary form of currency. They have started dying off en masse. \/[**adammichaelwood**](
36. A large portion of the economy is built on ship mortgages, shipping insurance, ship mortgage derivative securities, collateralized ship debt obligations. The sudden rise of an unusually powerful pirate fleet has thrown the economy into chaos. \/[**adammichaelwood**](

39. A disease renders 70% of the peasant/labor class unable to do manual labor. The labor shortage brings with it a huge increase in worker value and negotiating power, threatening to radically upset the social hierarchy. \/[**adammichaelwood**](
40. In a theocratic society, the high priest declares that he has a new message from God: all debts must immediately be forgiven. This either causes a massive economic upset (if the command is followed) or a societal shift away from theocracy (if it is not). Civil war looms.  \/[**adammichaelwood**](
41. An economy built on energy extraction (coal, oil, gas, or whatever) is thrown into chaos when a group of magicians realize that energy can be freely created, and that the Law of Conservation of Energy is actually a political conspiracy invented to protect the profit interests of energy companies.  \/[**adammichaelwood**](
42. A wish-granting magical device explodes, creating a region in which any item or material wished for immediately appears.  \/[**adammichaelwood**](

45. There is a new good in the market; whether because it is addictive, or its sellers are using predatory prices, it is blowing the competition out of the water and leading many to ruin.

50. Constant border warfare is drawing the peasantry away from the fields in order to join the fray as mercenaries and looters. The fields are left empty, however, and the realm needs to find a way to avert famines.
51. A community is caught in the middle of a sudden golden rush; rampant inflation ensues, relations between locals and outsiders are increasingly strained, as everywhere tries to turn a quick buck and the local authorities try to stop the place from being ""robbed"".
52. A conspiracy to overthrow the government brews in a city with minting privileges - its rulers are trying to accomplish it by manipulating the realm's economy.
53. A precious and coveted mineral is extremely noxious, and its extraction is eating away at the health of its miners, who work in the most precarious conditions.
54. A country's government is stripped of its primary functions, as they are sold one by one to pay off a ruinous debt.
55. A kingdom has gone into massive debt to finance a war against what they thought was a resource-rich rival kingdom, assuming that winning the war would provide plenty of profits to pay the debt. The war has been won, but they were quite wrong about the other kingdom’s natural wealth. \/[**adammichaelwood**](
56. A dragon has been defeated. The hoard hitting the market causes rapid devaluation of gold, causing farmers to suddenly become more wealthy than merchants. \/[**adammichaelwood**](
57. An alien intelligence (or aberration or whatever) desires an abundance of a particular useless weed, for its own inscrutable purposes. Through mind control (or other means) it slowly converts an entire society’s economy toward the cultivation of this one weed, leading to starvation, poverty, and eventual (if not stopped) collapse. \/[**adammichaelwood**](
58. All financial records are housed in a single repository. It burns down. \/[**adammichaelwood**](
59. A supernaturally persuasive public intellectual convinces a majority of the population that “money isn’t real” and that “gold has no intrinsic value”.

73. Speculation runs rampant and unregulated. \/[**DavidECloveast**](
74. A large majority of the population becomes convinced that the world will end soon, and gives away their property. The unconvinced, of course, are happy to accept it all. The end of the world does not happen. \/[**adammichaelwood**](
75. A ship carrying required annual tribute/tax to the Emperor sinks. The Emperor demands a make-up collection, regardless of the extreme hardship this will place on the local population. \/[**adammichaelwood**](
76. Due to a recently revealed prophecy, temple tithes must be now paid using a particular ancient copper coin that hasn’t been minted in generations. Counterfeiting, extortionary exchange rates, archeological raiding, and religious dissent ensue. (Bonus: tomb raiding leads to an undead problem) \/[**adammichaelwood**](
77. A well-respected alchemical society announces they have discovered the secret of turning base metals into gold. The value of gold plummets, causing massive market disruptions and a sell-off. It is later discovered that the alchemists were lying and secretly bought up most of the gold at rock-bottom prices. \/[**adammichaelwood**](
78. An arms race between central bank minters and several counterfeiting syndicates leads to increasingly complex currency, until eventually the cost of creating currency exceeds its nominal value. \/[**adammichaelwood**](
79. An insane king declares a different currency every few days. All transactions must be conducted using shoes. Then walnuts. Then rabbits feet. Then horse manure. \/[**adammichaelwood**](
80. A benevolent monarch in a resource rich nation attempts to eliminate poverty by instituting a Universal Basic Income. Most low-wage workers and manual laborers immediately quit working and many essential services and economic activities grind to a halt. \/[**adammichaelwood**](
81. A popular communist-like party takes control of government and promises that all jobs will pay exactly the same, the only important thing is that every citizen has to work at something. It turns out that everyone wants to be a street performer. \/[**adammichaelwood**](
82. A small nation state is the first in its region to legalize prostitution. Tourism and tax revenue skyrocket. When other states try doing the same thing, they inevitably fail or become scummy back-water dumps because all the best prostitutes have already moved. \/[**adammichaelwood**](
83. A society has most of its economy powered by slavery. The moment a more efficient, slave-free source of power is found, the slaves are freed en masse, with no compensation, creating a mass of destitute people.
84. A society in which exchanges do not use an official currency, but are rather regulated by subjective value: you have to offer something you deem worth the good or service you're buying, and somehow **prove** that it is worth that much.

311,"Weapon needs more customization, and since the game’s creators won’t fix it, we’ll do it ourselves.
Just comment with this format:
Title of Property (Melee/Ranged/Both/etc.): Descriptions and features.

1. Shark-Toothed (Both): Thin tooth-like blades run along the outside of this melee weapon. When you roll over 5 above the armor class of the target, you can impale the target. The weapon is attached to the target, and a creature must make a Strength check equal to 8+the attacker’s strength modifer to remove the weapon. The target takes 1d(hit dice of the weapon with this property) per turn until removed or 6 turns have passed.

2. Brute Force (Melee): If you miss by 1 with this weapon, you instead hit, dealing half the damage. You cannot deal sneak attack damage with the hit.

3. Razor Sharp (Both): This weapon is incredibly capable of inflicting grievous wounds. On a critical hit, triple the damage die with this weapon instead of doubling it.

4. Charge (Melee): This weapon can be used to deal lethal damage on a charge. If you move at least 20 feet in a straight line before engaging an opponent, you may choose to take a -4 modifier on your first attack roll against that creature. If you hit with that attack, you roll an additional damage die, equal to that of the weapon’s usual damage die.

5. Handy (Melee): You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature you are grappling, as well as against creatures that are grappling you.

6. Long (Melee): While you are wielding a long weapon, any creature that is not wielding a long weapon (or natural weapon of 10 feet reach) provokes an opportunity attack from you when they enter your reach. If you have the Polearm Master feat, you gain advantage on this roll. You have disadvantage to hit an opponent that is grappling you, or grappled by you, when you attack with a long weapon.

7. Parry (Both): When you are wielding a weapon with the parry property and a creature you can see hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to add 1 to your AC for that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you. You must have a Dexterity score of 13 or higher to take advantage of this feature, which can be used in conjunction with the Defensive Duelist feat. This is mostly on weapons like rapiers and scimitars, but it could potentially be placed on bows.

8. Savage (Melee): Savage weapons combine speed, weight and penetration, enabling them to deal decisive blows in combat. When you roll a 19 on an attack roll, roll an additional d6. If you roll the number given in parentheses next to the weapon, or higher, you score a critical hit. If the weapon has the versatile property reduce the number in the parentheses by 1, when it is wielded in two hands. If there is no number in parentheses, no need to roll a d6, a 19 is an automatic critical hit.

9. Shield-wrap (Both) You can ignore the armor class benefits of the target’s shield."
312,"I want to run a sci-fi game. The vibe I'm looking for is Firefly as acted out by Looney Tunes characters. 

I need some possible encounters for a derelict space freighter. 

1.  The hydroponic garden has gone rogue and produced sentient mushrooms that want to be eaten. And they promise they're not infectious. 

2. Coconut crab rodeo

3. The former crew tore open a hole to heck, where terrible annoyances will drive you mad.

4. The former Captain was trying to build a cyborg army.

5. The ship's AI had decided there's nothing left to live for, and is trying to dive into the nearest star.

6. The leftover stock in an abandoned towel factory has gone moldy enough to turn sentient and goes on a jihad against hitch-hikers across the galaxy. ( )

7. This sector is ruled by a totalitarian draconian bureaucracy, and you can't go anywhere or do anything without filling out dozens of forms. ( )

8. On this one planet everyone is very nice, drink tea and takes baths all the time. Always good for a good chat, but nobody there gets anything done. ( )

9. This nebula has the most fancy cafe inside it, there literally is coffee in that nebula. ( )

10. Evil dictator, aspiring emo rockstar, space boomer needs needs IT support to the space internet.

11. The atmospheric life support system is on the fritz.  It is adding high levels of helium to the air mix, which gives everyone a high squeaky voice like the Chipmunks.  ()
  
12. The atmospheric life support system is on the fritz.  It is adding high levels of a heavier than air gas to the air mix, which gives everyone a extremely deep voice like James Earl Jones.  ()
  
13. The AI on the (spaceship, space station) has gone a little bonkers.  It will no longer respond to commands unless you sing them.  I will do its job based on how good your singing is.  ()
  
14. There is a small alien that is trying to blow up a planet because it's blocking his view of another planet.  There is a critical component of his planet destroying weapon that he is missing.  This component is also easily accessible and easily stolen while it is inserted into the planet destroying weapon.  ()

15. The maintenance bots ran out of spare parts so they fixed the gravity generator with a clapper switch.  Now anytime someone claps or there is a loud thunk the gravity turns on or off. ()

16. A small, violent band of pirates board your vessel to take it over. They are both small and adorable. ( )

17. A mutagenic virus has infected a planet, turning it's inhabitants into 1930's rubberhose cartoons. ( )

18. A memetic trickster has appeared, and has turned reality UpSiDeDoWn.   ( )

19. For some reason, a perfectly content alien, disguised as one of the species on the ship, is sitting on an asteroid butt-naked.   ( )


20. A Megacorp has captured your party and refuses to let them go until they've completed some Catch-22 Product Testing. ( )

21. A large bulky alien has requested assistance. They are big enough to take up an entire room by themselves, and have to squeeze through the hallways. They are also VERY apologetic. ( )

22. A sentient-yet-incredibly-obnoxious Rogue Comet is so bored and lonely that it chases down spaceships and traps them in it’s ice just so it will have someone to talk to. ( )

23. Incredibly tiny space colonists have crashed into the spaceship/space station and have claimed it as their tiny new home world.  They live in the walls like borrowers, occasionally steal mundane objects like pencils or car keys, and can sometimes be found skiing and ice fishing in the freezer.  They regard the crew as local wildlife and the ship’s AI as a mysterious god-like entity; which is having quite the effect on said AI’s ego. ( )

24. A colossal and incredibly powerful alien with a child-like mind finds the Players so cute and adorable that they want to keep them as pets. ( )

25. Doppelgängers of the Party from an alternate mirror-dimension are suing the Players for _”stealing their look”._ ( )

26. _”Don’t order the Blue Plate Special.”_ ( )"
313,"Everyone loves a festival, right? They can be major events or fun gatherings your players will love to explore and give you great worldbuilding opportunities. Heres a few I've thought of so far.

&#x200B;

1. Feast Day - A day in which everyone in a village cooks a large meal. Everyone is to bring it to the village square for all to enjoy together. Alcohol welcome
2. War's End - A week long celebration the entire kingdom recognises in which the fallen are recognised and thanked for their sacrifices throughout the history of the kingdom
3. Festival of the Moon(s) - A gathering of people of which offerings to the moon(s) are made
4. Hero's Day - Typically celebrated by villages or towns in which the party or similar has made some serious impact, Hero's Day is celebrated by giving passing travellers special appreciation, and common folk sharing obviously made up and silly stories of adventures that absolutely have not happened, ever.
5. Elvish/Dwarvish/ect. Culture Day - A day when the history of the chosen race is celebrated, shared and taught by those apart of it to and for those out of it. The intention is to reduce discrimination."
314,"Any type of fairy tale themed magic items, weapons and artifacts. Stats are really appreciated! The characters are stuck in a Brother's Grimm-esque story book.

1. **Magic Mirror:** When targeted by a spell, the user can reflect th spell as a reaction. The mirror cracks and becomes unusable until the next dawn.

2. **The Hatter's Lost Hat:** The attuned user gains +3 to their Charisma score and is able to cast Vicious Mockery and Hideous Laughter at will. (Curse: While attuned you gain 1 permanent madness and have disadvantages on concentration checks.)

3. **The Tablecloth:** When laid out and the command word is spoken, Heroes Feast is cast once per day.

4. **Unicorn Horn Powder:** Can be used to cast Revivify with no other material components.

5. **Talisman of the Wild:** Allows the user to speak with animals at will.

6. **Flour of Power:** Any baked good made with this flour becomes animated and sentient. There’s enough flour to make a dozen cookies, six biscuits, or one loaf of bread. The resulting creation has eyes and can talk. The creator has no control over the creations, which beg to be devoured. After several days they become stale, moldy, and increasingly despondent and miserable. If (before being baked) they are shaped into a form with legs, e.g. a gingerbread man or animal crackers, they can run around, but their arms are too weak to lift more than an ounce. The animals will behave like their real-life forms (tigers are feisty predators, horses are skittish herd animals, etc.), but they will crumble if they pounce on each other. Gingerbread men are surprisingly rude and obnoxious. (But still wish to be eaten.) 

7. **Lucky Penny:** (requires attunement) This seemingly useless tarnished coin from a long-forgotten ancient realm, if tossed, always lands on the face called by the owner. If spent, discarded, or otherwise willingly given away, the coin returns somewhere in your possession (a pocket, purse, or pack) after your next long rest. Even if the coin is melted or disintegrated it somehow returns intact to you, as tarnished as it was before. The downside is it takes up an attunement slot and eventually you may want to get rid of it for something better. But the only way to be rid of the coin is to have it legitimately stolen from you, or to use a Wish spell. (Or die.) 

8. **Lovers’ Rings:** (requires attunement) These identical rings if found are usually in a set of two; just one has no magical effect. They appear worthless, cheap brass set with fake glass stones. But if worn and attuned by two people who are in love and faithful to each other, the rings are sparkling diamonds set in glittering gold. If one partner is no longer in love, is no longer faithful, or removes the ring (or dies), both rings revert to their original ugly state.


9. **Oven of the Coven:** This quaint, rustic oven fits the decor of your home, whether it’s a candy cabin, a scary shack, or a hag’s hovel. It’s small enough to fit inside any kitchen, but has an extradimensional space inside large enough to accommodate up to two fattened-up children. 

10. **Double Double Cauldron Bubble:** There’s no toil and no trouble with our new cast iron extra large cauldron. Any liquid added to the cauldron heats up to the desired temperature, up to a boil, within moments! 

11. **Pointy Hat:** This hat can only be removed after the wearer speaks a command word. Never lose your hat again while soaring across the night sky on your broomstick (broomstick sold separately).


12. **Dinglehopper**  While it looks like an ordinary fork, any creature that holds it while underwater can breathe normally as if in air. 

13. **Little Bears Bowl** Once per day, this simple wooden bowl magically fills with the exact right amount of food when a creature holds it in both hands and says ""That's just right.""

14. **Millers Spinning Wheel**  Using this simple looking spinning wheel, a creature can turn 1 lb of straw into 1GP with 15 min of work. The wheel then locks up and cannot be operated again until the next day.


15. **Golden Lock:** A lock of hair from the princess Rapunzel. Once per day, a creature can speak the command phrase (Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair) and transform the Golden Lock into a *Rope of Climbing*. The Lock cannot be used like this again until the next dawn.

16. **Glass Slippers:** (Requires attunement) A pair of beautiful slippers, crafted from the finest glass and imbued with fey magic. Once per day, a creature can speak the command word (Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo) and cast *Disguise Self* on themselves, which lasts until the stroke of midnight. The slippers cannot be used like this again until the next dawn.

17. **Godmother’s Whistle:** Once per day this whistle will call down an enormous flock of birds. The birds will devour any grain, seed, or other small edible item in the area before flying away.

18. **Woodsman’s axe:** (Requires attunement)This magic axe is always sharp and doubles chopping speed. When wielded as a weapon, it is a +2 battle axe. When you attack a creature that has devoured or engulfed another being whole within the last 48 hours and roll a 20, the most recently devoured creature is released.

19. **The Singing Bone** This flute gives a +1 bonus to spells when used as a bardic focus. While attuned, any works of art the wielder creates will feature a man who kills his brother and dumps his corpse off a bridge. 

20. **The White Snake** When eaten, a creature has Speak With Animals cast on them, lasting for 24 hours. The snake is large enough for 5 bites. 

21. **The Golden Goose** As long as this goose is well fed and comfortable, once per day, it will produce a golden egg, worth 50 GP each, which restore 1d8 hit points when eaten. The goslings that hatch from these eggs do not retain their mother's magical properties. 

22. **Sweet Porridge Pot** A small, sooty cauldron which, upon speaking the command word, will produce bland but filling porridge at a rate of 1 gallon per turn. It will continue to do this until the other command word is spoken, or the pot is destroyed. 

23. **Donkey Cabbages** Any creature that consumes this cabbage must make a DC15 Wisdom saving throw, or be transformed into a Donkey, as if it were affected by Polymorph.

24. **Vorpal Blade** - The original blade of legend.  The blade of this +6 longsword is made from the very concept of sharpness itself given form.  It does 2d8 slashing damage and acts as though possessing both the vorpal and keen enchantments, and ignores armor and damage reduction.

25. **Death's Herbs** (from Godfather Death)
""A small pouch of dried black herbs that seems to refill itself"". When you administer these herbs to a creature, roll a d20. On a 6-20, the creature regains 3d8 hit points and is cured of any negative conditions. On a 1-5, the creature immediately dies.

26. **The Fairy’s Fiddle** (Attunement):  This fiddle and bow are carved from living wood from the Feywild, and are charged with the wild revelry of that plane’s inhabitants.  When attuned, this fiddle serves as a spell casting focus that provides a +1 to the DC of any Enchantment or Illusion spell cast with it. Once per long rest, the wielder of this fiddle can begin to play a bewitching melody as a full round action.  Any creature aside from the fiddler who hears this melody must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom Save, or be affected as though by Otto’s Irresistible Dance, except that the duration lasts as long as the fiddler plays, and those affected may only take an action to save against the effect once every hour.  Every hour, both the fiddler and any affected creatures must make a DC 16 Constitution Save or take a level of Exhaustion.  If the fiddler fails this Save, they must immediately stop playing."
315,"**Da Rules** - Pick a fairytale, even if it has been mentioned before, put the name, and then describe a quick quest the players need to do using the framework of that story. It doesn't need to be super long, just a little pitch is fine.

Shakespeare (Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, etc) and other classic stories are also fine, since they usually take inspiration from earlier things anyway.

Also it's flaired as ""high fantasy"" because it's folklorical. If you're gonna put in stuff from Dragon Game 5 like ""bladesingers"" and whatnot, *explain what those are*. Too often I have to ask what's one thing or another because folks just assume everyone plays the same game as them!

Let's get to it.

1. (Sleeping Beauty) This one's straightforward. Ever since you were a boy, there's tales about the curse of the Castle Grimm that made everyone fall asleep, and they've been like that ever since your dad was a boy - at least. Brave the castle, possibly escorting this handsome youth who's a good man but really can't handle a sword, and wake the beauty up. Careful though; they say the Enchantress who put her to sleep raised guardians to keep folks at bay.

2. (Cinderella) The prince has invited everyone in the kingdom for the big royal ball. On your way, you see a young lady crying that she can't go because her parents suck ass. Except she doesn't seem to realise she can do wondrous magic just by wishing it really hard! Act as Fairy Godmother to her and guide her to make sure she sticks the landing.

3. (Little Red Riding Hood) You see a little girl in a red hood going down the woods. She says she's a bit scared and asks if you can escort her just down the lane, to her granny's house. The Wolf appears, not a big deal... except the Wolf has a pack. And now they're hungry and want vendetta.

4. (Snow White) You find yourself hunting with a rich dude, somehow. In the midst of it you find a glass coffin in the middle of the woods with a lady looking like she's dead in there. The rich dude decides to take her to her home so a doctor can see her - or a cleric, if you have one of those around. As soon as Snow White wakes up, though, by the next sunset the Evil Queen will show up and try to kill her the good ol' fashioned way: by stabbing her.

5. (Hansel and Gretel) You find a pair of kids walking around in the woods, clearly lost, dropping breadcrumbs so they won't lose their way. Looking behind them, you can see far off in the distance the flock of birds that has been following them, looking fatter now. Escort them out of the woods and you'll find a delicious gingerbread house with a witch hankering for some children to eat.

6. (Jack and the Beanstalk) An angry youth is kicking around being equal parts angry and depressed. You see, he just sold his cow for this single ""magic"" bean and now his dad might kick his ass. Yeet the bean, it'll grow into a huge beanstalk, and a ""dungeon"" in the sky. Careful though, the giant will soon come. (Or simply play The Waking of Willowby Hall)

7. (Beauty and the Beast) Aw man it's awful! This woman, Beth, went up to the castle on the hill some time ago and she hasn't come back. We need someone to go up there and check, and bring Beth back.

8. Goldilocks and the Three Bears: A young druid rebels against her ancestral circle and has been terrorizing travelers through the forest with her 3 bear companions. [/Bob_Gnoll]

9. (Hand My Hedgehog): The PCs hear rumors of a strange creature riding a chicken hiding in the woods and stealing livestock. Everyone who encounters him ends up shredded. The truth is a young noble was cursed in the womb and shunned by his family. Can you cure him and reunite him with his kin? [/Thepipe90]

10. (Frau Holle) you find an elderly woman living on a farm. The farm is hopelessly falling apart as she is no longer able to take care of it by herself. Her (elephant sized) chickens have escaped, he scarecrows came to life and her well has dried up. If you help her she promises to make you dinner. She is secretly a fey and will reward good behavior with coin and a heroes' feast. [/Jax_for_now]

11. Shrek: A woodsman has spotted a large beast in the nearby forest and has rallied the villagers together to hunt and kill it before it causes any harm... Can be an ogre, troll or hill giant... Or whatever you want it to be. [/No_Use_For_Name___]

318,"As it says, I'm planning a hex-crawl across a shattered world, where, at the best of times, a group traveling the planet is lucky to come across nothing at all. Most of the planet is 100% lifeless, which means no animals, no plants, no microbes in the air or soil; dead, absolutely and completely. It was a renaissance world of magic and technology, and the remnants still clinging to life are vicious, full of trickery, and will do anything they can to keep going.

Ideally, send me a title, a description of the landscape, and a description of a challenge. Here we go, let's fill my maps:

1. Dust Devils, (Jhaosmire): Across the plains that should be thick with wheat and rye, the dust of disturbed dirt blows. The dust clings to the inside of your nose, and you wish it smelled like death, but it is dry and scentless, quickly clogging up your nostrils and forcing you to rudely clear your sinus' frequently. Then they form: the wind, whipping harder and stronger, without branch or bark to arrest their development, merges and twists and forms into several spiraling vortexes, stretching from earth to sky. Jagged shards of rock are torn from the lifeless soil and lashed in every direction.
2. Castle of Flies, (Jhaosmire): Once, upon a better time, there must have been a glorious castle, up on a small hill, protected and protecting. There are indicators in the roadway that human feet once trod upon the land, but the aberrational visage your now behold holds no trace of humanity. The walls of this former castle writhe and coil. Maggots the size of wagons slither out of ""windows"" and flop down below into a massive blob of like creatures. From their slimy depths, winged insectoids, large enough to carry a horse, slide their way out of the muck and swarm the skies.
3. Devil's Train, (Jhaosmire): Tracks lay in your path. They stretch to the left and to the right, endless in each direction. The metal of their rails is rusted over, except on the inside, where recent use has worn away the outermost layer of rust. Putting your hand to the rail, it is cold, despite the heating radiating down from above. And then it's vibrating. Shaking. The air around you quivers with the ominous incoming of a vehicle beyond proper description. A railway train has a locomotive in front and cars behind it, and this fits that mold. Beyond the shape, nothing is natural. The face of a barbed, lacerated and open mouthed devil careens towards you. Behind the haunting visage, carts not on wheels but on hands and wrists bloodily slap the ground to push the train forward. On the carts are piles of living organs, pulsing, digesting, and spewing forth ichor and brine in their wake. This monstrosity of monstrosities, moving with a preternatural pace, will be upon you within moments.
4. Ghost Town, (Jhaosmire): Trying to find your path, whether on purpose or by an unconscious natural tendency, has lead you to a familiar site. The boards are petrified and cracked. The wall is toppled and ruined. But the arrangement is right. Your hometown, what remains of it, lays before you. Once buried in a thick forest, hidden on old trails and in a hard to reach corner of the world, it has aged. The trees are like standing driftwood, ready to topple at any moment. Walking through the warped memory of your childhood, you feel it on your skin, moments before hearing it in your ears. Eyes are upon you, watching you, but they are the eyes of the dead. Creaks of bones pressing on bone, as leathery sinew struggles to hold it together. Emerging all around you, from the holes in walls and the doorways without doors, bodies stumble forward. The bodies are desiccated and parched, devoid of all moisture. Then you hear it, above the snapping of joints, above the groans of jerked windpipes, comes the voice. ""Ho there. This is not your home, but it will be...""
5. Tribesmen, (Jhaosmire): There has been no signs of life for days. That ends when a caravan, distant at first, marching diagonally to your location, turns and begins moving towards you. They are robed, they are caked in the dust of the barren trails, and they know where you are. What lies in their covered wagons? What has kept them alive in such a hostile landscape? Whatever it is, whatever they are, you'll know within the hour, for here they come.
6. Glowing Pond, ([**wirrbeltier**]( dotting the lifeless rock desert are small ponds, uniform in size and full of brackish, muddy water. They are rimmed by thorny bushes and crippled trees, grasping at the sky with their knotted branches like dying hands. Once a month, the ponds pulse with a strange droning sound, making the bushes sprout colorful flowers, thin like soap bubbles. From the mud, thousands of thumb-sized larvae erupt, nest in the shade, and convert to hand-sized butterflies, iridescing like oil slicks. In the greenish glow the ponds emit that night, they feast on the flowers and mate, only to drop dead in the mud by dawn. It's fascinating to watch, and even more fascinating to dive into the ponds while they glow. You might even live to learn their secret - just don't disturb the butterfly swarm mother's dreams, or you will get devoured by the pond and fuel the next luminous cycle.
7. The Monster's Graveyard, ( [**World\_of\_Ideas**]( ): The land is dusty, cracked and dry. As you come up over another ridge you see it. The bones of great beast rest here. Thousands of them, spread out over the wasteland as far as the eye can see. The smallest of them would fill a castle's courtyard. At least they might provide some shade. As you make your way through the remains of these giants, you begin to feel like a mouse with a wolf staring at it. Out of the corner of you eyes you see movement or was it just your imagination. The wind carries a faint howling noise that sends goosebumps down your back and causes all your hair to stand on end. Your heart begins to pound in your chest. You feel that at any moment something is about to pounce on you.
8. Petrified Forest, ([**TheZintis**]( You see what looks like tall buildings in the distance, and as you approach realize they are not. Incredibly tall trees in a small forest loom before you. Approaching reveals that these are not ordinary, they are colossal, hundreds of feet high. Walking up to them they feel like stone, and they have no branches. They are petrified, a stone monument to the forest that once was here, weathered and beaten.
9. Futurist Outcast, ([**TheZintis**]( You barely see them, but a youth has been following you for part of the day. They attempt to stay out of sight, but you call to them and they confront you. They wear a simple white gown, and are perfectly healthy (a rarity here). You interrogate them, and they divulge that they came from a small complex nearby, full of chambers containing people, frozen in time. The monitor of the complex notified them that it could not keep all the people suspended and had to eject one to preserve the others while they wait for the Apocalyptic conditions to change. The complex is full of interesting technology, a power source, the monitor, and the youth will defend it if you try to damage it. They seem resigned to die in the wasteland to save their friends/family.
10. Fallout Survivalists, ([**TheZintis**]( You are ambushed by an incompetent group of barbarians, with the most incredible weapons. They are unbelievably dumb, you can see signs of brain damage and congenital defects easily. But somehow they have their hands on weaponry that, if properly wielded, would vaporize you instantly. You and your party manage to defeat them, and track them back to their home; also a very advanced building (more like a fortress). There are a few dozen more of them there, and despite the disparity in armaments they are defeated. The building has a power source as it's core that hums and booms, automated factories and food production. Yet all the inhabitants are suffering, showing signs they were once intelligent (diaries, videos, etc...). It's not obvious to you, but their power source poisoned them (radiation). Given the choice of dying in the wasteland or suffering at home... If you stay there too long you will start to show the same signs.
11. Sandstone and Sand Storms, ( [**killllllllllmeeeeee**]( ): A deep sandstone canyon with constant dust storms of sharp rock and bone, these storms blow up sometimes and shred the surrounding areas and can go on for months going for miles upon miles.
12. Generations of Waste, ( [**killllllllllmeeeeee**]( ): A near flat plain of waste and trash that seems to go on forever, puddles of dirty water and a mud made out of trash make it extremely hard to travel, but riches can be found here if you are resourceful enough.
13. Nature Finds a Way, ( [**killllllllllmeeeeee**]( ): A very large forest that has nearly all its trees but with a bit of lush undergrowth growing back from the forest floor. Several small hamlets and dead structures have been burnt here as well, small animals have started returning and survival is relatively easy.
14. The Statue, ([**THEChanger7**]( Once, it stood as a symbol of progress and largess, a great bronze statue in the shape of a mighty warrior. Once, it stood as a marvel of engineering and magic, a mechanical defender of a prosperous city. Once, it stood as a symbol of everything its people had achieved and would achieve. Once, it stood. Now it crawls, gears and voice groaning under the strain of its own weight. The once bright brass is now a muddy green, oxidized and rusted after eons. Its legs lie elsewhere, presumably in whatever graveyard remains of its former home. Now it carries out the last commands of its maker, a mission it cannot complete for a people that no longer exist. And you are in its way.
15. The Desiccated Fog, ([**MaxSizeIs**]( The driest area, yet somehow with a layer of fog rising up over a mile, comprised of finely powdered salts, peroxides, and silicates that remain in suspension and within the area in even the strongest gales. Something about the area causes water to disappear, even that stored in sealed containers. In wind storms, the fog rubbing leads to static electricity, dry lightning strikes, and the epitaxial growth of large crystals that sing and vibrate when the winds blow.
16. City of Concrete Canyons, ([**MaxSizeIs**]( This seems like it used to be a city, before the event, but the city couldn't possibly have been this large; hundreds, or possibly thousands of twenty and thirty story structures of brutalist, dust-stained concrete, spreading for miles... perhaps never ending. Each one is distressingly similar in size and layout, possibly giving one the distinct impression that these were never meant for habitation, most being completely devoid of the typical contents of buildings, and just being empty shells. Close study and prolonged exploration might reveal differences in the structures, this one bears small cultural symbols on some of the prominent entrances, this other one has collapsed completely, this one has large holes from combat... the city develops a bit of a personality. The problem with the area, is that it bears a number of memetic imprints; some spots convince minds that the city is still populated, some glimmers of hostile movement, others that the city is never-ending, that the city is and always will be across the vastness of time and space, etc.
17. The Hum, ([**MaxSizeIs**]( No one knows what purpose the great, rusting iron towers once served. They simply know that there are hundreds of them, in a nearly perfect line, several hundred feet apart, for dozens of miles. Many have collapsed into twisted piles of bent and rusted metal, but few venture near to gather the scraps for the dreadful noise that fills one's mind, obliterating organized thought, leaving only the mind-killing ""hum"". Some are less sensitive to it, it is true, but none are immune. Spend too long nearby and lose all sense of self, all control, and wind up waking up who knows when, who knows where...
18. The Wellspring, ([**MaxSizeIs**]( A verdant oasis, or what used to be. Now it has dried to a mere trickle, and the water is alkali poison and contaminated with a sludge that moves and attacks living creatures that attempt to drink. The sludge is just sentient enough to remove or conceal the remains of victims, but isn't perfect.
19. *Luctus Flamma*, ([**MaxSizeIs**]( A wreath-crown of black, celestial wings continually fan the unholy flame atop the head of this abomination. A skeletal death's head covered in ever-dripping wax, crowned by flame and backed by a verdigris covered bronze reflector, sits atop a too-tall black-boned angelic skeleton inside a now-corrupted suit of celestial plate-mail. It is truly giant. It wears chains formed of adamantine, and wields them as weapon. It is said that its flame is that of one of the heavens, and melts through the falsehood that is safety. None have seen it up close, few have seen it on the horizon and survived. Beware the 60 foot line of unholy fire that damages even magical arms and armor.
20. *Matrona Maris Misericordiae*, ([**MaxSizeIs**]( A bowl-like depression with a large toxic lake at the bottom. A scavenger camp, seemingly abandoned but with untouched, rotting food left on tables in serving dishes, bedrolls lovingly made, and formerly well-kept, well-built huts. Evidence of lonely children's toys, from before the event, peek from hidden corners, forgotten to the elements. A throne-like shrine sits close to the shore of the water; offerings of faded silk flowers and corroded ancient coins are piled at the feet of the beatific, smiling, small statue of a veiled woman. The scavengers who once lived here are gone; all taken by the Matron of the Sea of Mercy. No corpse remains, and everything remains un-looted. Little known, the large lake occasionally emits poisonous, but odorless fumes. Also little known, something else comes through and removes the bodies, leaving the rest of the place untouched.
21. Windswept Crag, ([**MaxSizeIs**]( A village of staunch survivalists in a nameless village tenaciously cling to the cliffside here, in multistory, mudbrick and loose stone huts. A tiny well-spring deep in a windswept crack of a cave, serves as their only source of clean water. They are xenophobic zealots who practice sky burial (the area is lousy with rotting human remains and carrion eaters), forced trepanation (the drilling of holes in one's skull), and a strict prohibition on the use or knowledge of personal names.
22. The Bridge-dwellers, ([**MaxSizeIs**]( reside in, on, and suspended directly beneath of, the remains of a great bridge over a deep ravine and fast moving watercourse. Both ends of the structure have been demolished, leaving a lone stretch of bridge structure, more or less in the center, still standing. Law breakers, bandits, and those who fail to swear fealty to the Rightful Ruling Faction (now, undoubtedly extinct) are either gibbeted, and suspended over the waterway, or tied up and dunked until death by drowning occurs.
23. The Rain of Obsidian, ([**MaxSizeIs**]( there used to be a mountain here, before the event, it's gone now. Literally cubic miles of solid rock were transformed into a cloud of vaporized silica and glass shards that rained down for dozens of miles, coating the mountain facing side of everything with a layer of glass, several inches thick. Surprisingly, although it killed all life within its blast, it left perfect casts, and somehow failed to ignite anything on contact. The dead, now perfectly cast on one side, fail to rot, and simply desiccate inside their cloudy glass cocoons.
24. *Luctus Reductus*, ([**MaxSizeIs**]( It used to be a thriving agrarian, and generally normal, kingdom; now it is permanently below sea level, reduced to a salty marsh where almost nothing grows, and is covered in a thick layer of choking clouds that permanently blot out the sun. The clouds are toxic, of course, when they descend on particularly bad days. Only the Undead remain.
25. Last Voyage of the Airship Pirates, (Jhaosmire): They start as a speck on the horizon, but quickly grow in size as they've veered your way. A balloon, partially deflated already, keeps the derelict ship low in the sky. Not a few hundred feet from your location, a spark ignites and flames pour out of the rear of the envelope, with two consequences: one, the airship speeds forward with a burst of inertia, and two, you see the savage, bestial eyes of madmen whose hunger for blood has pushed them into this suicidal feat. The ship is going to crash and burn, and they've targeted you for their final trajectory.
26. Poisonous Smog, (Jhaosmire): The air is thick and muddy. Putting rags, spare clothing, or whatever scraps you can find over your face only somewhat stops the sewage from leaking into your mouth and nose, and you're forced to raise the mask and spit every minute, a black ichor that numbs your tongue. Is a forest burning, or an oil field? Whatever it is, it plays havoc with your senses, turning you all about, and before long the dizziness of the fumes has your head spinning.
27. Magnetic Vortex, (Jhaosmire): The land around you is featureless. Not boring, not sparse, but absolutely blank. Sand stretches for miles in every direction, level and soft. You trudge through it, endlessly. The first day is awful, the second day worse. On the third, you begin to suspect it will never end, looking up at the blazing evening sun on the eastern horizon; and that's when you realize the problem. The sun is on the wrong side. The compass is pointing you northward, but it's been lying. Following it has lead you in circles for three days now, and as night sets in, you worry if even the sun will rise on a different horizon, if you'll be forever lost wandering an endless circle..."

320,"Hey all,

So I have an idea of making a dungeon that’s actually a library.

It’s one room. The party picks a book off the shelf and is probably going to ask the name.

I figure if I build a D100 list of book titles, and write adventures or encounters based on those titles it’ll be a fun time for everyone.

The goal is to make the titles not so obvious the party knows what’s coming…

Puzzles, traps, and the like are of course fair game!

So let’s hear your suggestions!

\*EDIT\* This is my first list here, so apologies if I'm doing something wrong- bear with me and advise and I'll happily correct. TIA

\---

**d100 Books that are Adventures**

1. The Apothecaries Guide to Drosera : The Party gets teleported to an encounter where they must fight a Corpse Flower, in its lair, while the floor is sticky (Drosera are sticky trap carnivorous plants)  \[/Maleficent-Orange539\]

7. The Maiden / The Mother / The Crone : A trilogy set of books where players are transported without rest to three sequential encounters. In the first, they are assigned by the king to prosecute witches in the countryside, and they find themselves entering a small town where a girl is accused of wichcraft. The scene quickly flashes to a trial where they have overwhelming evidence (eyewitness reports etc) that she is a witch. Finding her guilty and succeeding in book 1 means they end up fighting two hags in the second encounter, and three in the third. Balance as appropriate to make the encounters very hard. Finding her innocent despite everything makes them a friend to witches, and book 2 is bringing acceptance to the village of witches, then book 3 is defending the town from a horde with the assistance of three fully qualified witches, magic flying everywhere, players getting tons of assistance and kicking ass.  \[/bigvyner\]

The audience is all of the people and creatures they've ever killed and their families. Each of them tell their story about how traumatizing it was to meet the party. \[/bigvyner\]
11. Red Dragon: You'd think this would be a simple dragon, but nope, the players appear at the bottom of a deep pit, along with an innocent girl, who tells them she is being kept there by a serial killer who makes her put on skin moisturizer every day... oh no here he comes! If you want to add more difficulty the killer is being mentally controlled by a literal red dragon, which attacks the party when the killer is defeated.  \[/bigvyner\]
12. Cholm's book of Riddles: A room that fills slowly with water, the only way out is a door which can only be opened by speaking the correct answer to the riddle. Each incorrect word spoken aloud increases the flow of the water. \[/bigvyner\]

Once they do or do not do business the party continues down the road. Not 20 minutes later do they spot, hanging from the branches above, a gooey flesh covered quilt of flesh. Once they retrieve it they discover it to be the skin of the salesmen they just met, and he's still alive! Bobby speaks in muffled words but assures them a witch stole his skeleton and brought it to life. He offers the party his good magic items if they help him. The party must slay the witch, reunite the skeleton and Bobby or leave Bobby to his fate after discovering he attempted to rip off the Witch with his bogus magic items. \[/needleknight\]"

324,"I have this idea of starting a game when the character is a kid and the first session being just small vignettes and little scenes where we see more of the infancy and what shaped the character. Let's make 1d100 scenes about that!

Assume a Medieval setting with fantasy elements but not a lot of different races and things like that. You can put them in, if you really want, but it'd be cooler and more game-agnostic if we avoided it.

1. The character's mom gets very frustrated and starts shaking their baby sibling a bit more vigorously than she should. Do they stop her?

2. A couple of the character's peers are mocking another person of the opposite gender (girls are icky! boys are stinky!), do they join in the mockery and make the other person feel worse but creates camaraderie with their peers? Or do they antagonize their peers and stand up for the other person?

3. The character is still young, maybe 10 years old, and a younger sibling or friend asks them why is there so much injustice in the world. What view about that has already started to develop in the character's mind?

4. What happened on the first night the character was outside and beyond their home, all alone in the dark? [/AlephAndTentacles]

5. What was the first 'treasure' that the character gained? How did they obtain it? Was this what lead them to their current occupation? [/AlephAndTentacles]

6. While out in the woods gathering materials with guardian (mother, father, uncle, etc) and younger sibling, they are attacked by wild animals (wolves, whatever). Guardian tells child to take sibling and flee. Do they follow the instructions (guardian dies and sibling lives)? Or do they attempt to stave off the animals (leading to the death of the sibling)? [/dualgauge]

7. Father is a farmer. PC and siblings worked long hours in the field rising early and finishing at sunset. Experience/trait: strong willed, bonus to constitution, resourceful. [/No_Use_For_Name___]

8. Father worked as a 'smithy. PC helped. XP: An eye for detail, able to appraise metals. [/No_Use_For_Name___]

9. Mother died of a fever while PC was young. Father was a hard, bitter man who beat the children relentlessly. XP: strong resolve, high pain threshold, good fighter. [/No_Use_For_Name___]

10. Parents both killed in a village fire. PC grew up as a street urchin. XP: thief, fast talker, street wise, suspicious of authority. [/No_Use_For_Name___]

11. The PC's closest sibling was killed in a farming accident. PC struggles with guilt and blames themselves over the incident. [/No_Use_For_Name___]

12. PC's parents joined a death cult and were later executed by the authorities. PC is very anti-religion. [/No_Use_For_Name___]

13. PC had a nasty fall from a horse. PC is uncomfortable around horses. [/No_Use_For_Name___]

14. As a little kid, the PC's parents are about to have another kid. How does the PC feels about this? Do they get jealous of their little sibling?

15. The PC was once in battle, either as a squire to a knight or a footman or something like that. They're on the sidelines of the battle with other squires and footmen when they see the leader of their company being swarmed by enemies, but the standard is still aloft and he's fighting very bravely. Does he rally the other squires to try and help the guy, even if that can end up giving him a nasty wound? Or does he take advantage of the situation to run away?

16. You were always the lightest sleeper of the family and one night you are awoken by a noise. You creep from your bedroom and see a thief ransacking your kitchen. Do you scream for help? Are you shocked into silence? How does the thief react when he detects you? Does this make you paranoid in the future, or perhaps cynical? [/RealRamessesII]

17. When doing your chores one morning you hear a shuffling noise from the ground. You go over and see a dying bird, it appears to have been wounded by a predator but left to die. The ground gleams red with blood as the bird struggles in vain to fly, weak chirps coming from its beak. How do you react? Do you try to save the bird, watch it, ignore it, something else? [/RealRamessesII]

18. You're visiting the market one day when your father says ""There's a special show goin' on today, c'mon kid."" He leads you to another block where a man is being publicly executed. The black-hooded attendant reads out his crimes, the crowd throws trash at him and he shouts curses in return. The look on his face as he is finally hanged is horrible. ""That's what happens if you cross the law,"" your father says casually. ""Crime doesn't pay, eh kid?"" How do you react to all of this? Does your opinion on crime, justice or your father change? [/RealRamessesII]

19. It was a bad summer, simple as. Weather, locusts, disease, whatever; the crops failed. It's a famine. Your family only has a little food that's gonna have to last all winter. You don't know if the government is going to help yet. Your father has been talking to each household member in hushed tones, finally he comes over to you. ""You're old enough to give your two cents, I guess,"" he says wearily. ""What do you think we should do?"" How do you respond? Does your father take your advice? How does the famine play out? [/RealRamessesII]"

338,"These encounters can be based on history, mythology or folklore, wildlife, culture or natural phenomena. Here are the cultures and anything I’ve thought of for them so far. Feel free to add stuff for cultures not on this list 

Edit: I didn’t make this clear, but I kept my examples a little vague because I have an additional table which determines the allegiance  (marine, pirate, revolutionary, bounty hunter, slaver, etc.) and the scale (house, island, archipelago, continent, sea, etc.) which the encounter covers. So, when a gunslinger from the American Wild West is rolled from this table, they might be the civilian owner of a saloon themed restaurant that deals with a few local ruffians, the king of a saloon nation at war with an army of outlaws or the emperor of a grand fleet of pirates whose struggles against a sea spanning hoard of rival gang members determines the fate of the world.

339,"This list is meant to spice up nautical campaigns in whatever system or setting by offering some danger to the players' vessel, be it a sailboat, a motorboat, submarine or any such waterborne vehicle.

Fantastical/supernatural examples as welcome as long as they are accessory to the storm. The storm is front and center, an antagonist in its own right.

&#x200B;

1. ""Interstellar (2014)"" wave incoming.
2. The ship is taking on water, and is in danger of sinking from the added weight of water.
3. An anchor or a heavy piece of rigging is set loose by a gale and flails around, damaging the ship and endangering the crew's life and limb.
4. The storm washes up a panicked, aggressive shark or similarly dangerous sea beast on deck.
5. The ship is thrown about by the waves and the winds, bouncing off the sea like a pebble. Its shock with the surface of the water could cause hull breaches.
6. A crewmember is stuck and/or trapped in rigging and risks drowning.
7. The ship is being pushed towards reefs or a cliffed coast.
8. The storm leaves no visibility to navigate through a particularly treacherous coast.
9. Man overboard! One or more player characters are cast off the ship by the storm, and are now in the desperate predicament of finding their way aboard again or being rescued amid the tempestuous sea.
10. The ship is riding the crest of a huge, steep wave, and risks falling off it as if on a waterfall.
11. The ship is blown way off course into unknown waters, with limited supplies.
12. A tsunami washes the ship deep inland. Its crew must figure out how to get it back to the sea.
13. Lightning strikes the ship, setting flammable objects on fire.
14. If the ship has masts, heavy winds topple them, leaving the ship with no source of traction and crushing anyone caught beneath them.
15. The ship barrel rolls with the waves. Any crew and objects in the lower decks are tossed around as if on a laundromat. The ship might have capsized, and those shelted in the lower decks must hope the ship is sealed well enough to stop it from sinking.
16. Important cargo is lost or the means of preserving it are lost.
17. Giant tidal waves are being frozen for one round and unfreeze the next 1-6 rounds \/[**Emotional\_Guillotine**](
18. After a storm, repairs are needed and must be made, be careful, as the sounds of hammering on the ship may attract predators \/[**giant\_spleen\_eater**](
19. Critical machinery starts malfunctioning after being soaked
20. A crewmember dangles atop a mast mid-storm.
21. The ship becomes stuck on a shallow sandbar. You'll have to wait for high tide or move the ship manually
22. Cargo breaks free from its straps and slides across the (deck, cargo hold) damaging anything in its path.
23. The tides bring a field of flotsam towards the ship, possibly causing collisions.
24. The deck becomes iced over and slippery due to (arctic temperatures, freezing rain, or snow).
25. The ship is sailing towards a maelstrom
26. If it is an oared ship, one of the sections loses its oars, crew.
27. The helm is stuck, making the ship steering in a single direction.
28. If on a convoy, one or more ships divert from the course. Alternatively, they collide against your own ship or each other.
29. The crew panics and starts behaving erratically.
30. The sails are torn by heavy winds.
31. Heavy objects are tossed around by the balance of the waves and knock crewmembers unconscious
32. The ship capsizes, it may or may not right itself without the player's intervention. Even so, the masts will be broken, and at least 25% of any cargo or passengers will be dangerously broken and drowned. \/[**MaxSizeIs**](
33. If the ship has hull-plating, it is wrenched free and requires replacement. If the ship doesn't have plating, there is now a hole in t he side of the ship. \/[**MaxSizeIs**](
34. An uncharted partially submerged reef threatens to snag the vessel unless the players spot it, which isn't easy. If the vessel strikes the reef, the waters are still possibly high enough that the heavily damaged ship could float free, but the tide is going out and soon that won't be an option, as there won't be enough water to keep the ship above the highest part of the reef. To complicate matters even further, as the vessel and cargo takes on water, it sits lower and lower and it becomes harder to free! \/[**MaxSizeIs**](

340,"I’m running a campaign where the players have inherited a lordship over a small city. I want every building they enter to feel like it could be it’s own story. What unique buildings/people might populate such a town?

1. An Orc restaurant owner in need of “delicate” ingredients that are really savage animals that need to be slain

2. A failed wizardry school that sits abandoned after the staff an disappeared 

3. A blacksmith shop run by a brawny man who makes horse shoes, nails, door hinges and the like. But not weapons. He’s genuinely surprised why someone would be making weapons when the real money is in nails.

4. An inn & tavern run by dwarves. All the chairs and beds are dwarf sized but it’s the most fun pub in town.

5. A scribe and messenger service. There’s really no reason why everyone in town should be able to read or write so most people use these robed scribes to get messages around. For your eyes only.

6. There’s a local thief problem. It’s not obvious where they are operating out of, but the city has thieves cant all over the place for the party’s rogue."
341,"This is an attempt to make a list of schemes similar to those of ""Shane the Shy"" the BBEG in this [Legendary Greentext.]( TLDR: Shane arranges quests that generally rookie and amateur adventurers can handle and they don't seem to have ill-intent. After they complete his quests he leaves the region and soon after the quests the adventurers did are somehow the cause of a regional conflict.

&#x200B;

1. You were sent to find record books, heirlooms, and art pieces. These items can be used by a disgraced noble to assert his claim to the throne but will cause a civil war.
2. You were sent to find agricultural artifacts. These items were given to malicious druids using plants to assault civilization.
3. You were sent to verify the existence of a gold vein for a mining company. It turns out the company works for a dragon wishing to grow its hoard.
4. You were sent to find weather-controlling artifacts. These items were given to revolutionaries that planned to attack a city with many new flammable buildings.
5. You were asked to transport rare exotic animals secretly to protect them from poachers. It turns out these animals inflict lycanthropy upon people that consume them.
6. You were sent to assist someone in reforming uncivilized people. It turns out that they plan to use these people to grow their own empire.
7. You were sent to clear a gang hideout. Later, a rival gang occupies this same hideout.
8. Guard some wizards while they finish casting Teleportation Circle in an isolated area in a walled city, the circle is used to bring in massive amounts of counterfeit gold coins that crater the local economy.
9. A small town asks the adventurers to recover a gem stolen by a local thieves guild, the town turns out to actually be a cult and the gem is actually the prison of an ancient god that the cult is now trying to release to kill everyone.-armored-boi
10. The adventurers find a prince on the side of the road that is lost and asks for help in getting home, turns out the prince is a key part of a prophecy that will plunge the kingdom into 1000 years of darkness and torment and the king was trying to save both the kingdom and his son by casting away the prince.-armored-boi
11. You are asked by a farmer on the edge of arable land to wipe out the monster packs harming his flock. Those packs kept away more monstrous elements, causing a famine as even the inner farms are now threatened.
12. A lay-priests tells you of a lost artifact of his religion, claiming it to be from the time of its founding and a symbol for their people. It is actually a source of a long-dead early heresy and a symbol of division. It being uncovered may be enough to reignite a bloody schism.
13. Rescue a local noble's daughter from the clutches of an orc Warlord. The lady was given to the orcs as part of an arranged marriage marking peace between the Orcs and the human settlement. This action will cause outright war to break out between the two.
14. Recover lost seeds in a wizard's tower to help the barren farmlands prevent famine. The seeds eventually grow into plant monsters that threaten to consume the surrounding lands.
15. Help a convoy transport medical supplies into a wartorn village. Said aid is also a cover to help the convoy smuggle dangerous magical weapons into the country.
16. Kill a bandit leader in the slums of a city. This leader is actually the head of a revolutionary group, whose murder makes him a martyr and galvanized the revolutionary sympathizers in the city into full civil war.
17. You’re sent to assassinate a maniacal, but emotional and incompetent dictator bent on enslaving and/or laying waste to the “undesirable” population of the region. His successor is much more logical and level-headed, and he is able to carry out his own plans of genocide much more effectively.
18. You are hired to distribute a vaccine/antidote/cure for a virus/disease that has been ravaging a duchy/kingdom. However, the disease as well as the cure have been concocted by the health minister/advisor to the duke/king and turns the people into bloodthirsty maniacs. (The advisor could've been paid or blackmailed by an enemy of the duke/king)
19. Find old letters of a long dead hero of the people who saved the country and distribute it to the scholars who are against the kingdom but, will claim they are impartial. The letters are encrypted and will be ""decrypted"" to show how much of a ""terrible"" person was. In reality.
20. Deliver a secret weapon that will turn the tides of a bloody war to a chaotic good rebellion leader against a tyrant. The secret weapon is a magical steroid that will kill the user in a matter of five months but, boost their abilities to inhuman levels with heightened but, controllable aggression.
21. Deliver a cart of fine cloth blankets to a charitynion that champions workers' rights before winter sets. The fine cloth is tainted with terrible illnesses which will kill a bunch of workers and their families and turn people against the charitynion.
22. Deliver dull yellow-green rocks to an artificer who is trying to make a new source of power from these strange rocks. The rocks are uranium-rich ore and nuclear fission will be made for better or worse.
23. Destroy a circle of druids who have been seen killing merchants who travel directly through the center of the forest for the last three decades. The center of the forest is a place where a weak subspecies of ettercap lays eggs inside of living people which turns them into disoriented husks that seek out cities. An outbreak of these weak opportunistic ettercaps will slowly kill and scar many people.
24. The group is paid to bury four stones in specific spots around the capital of the kingdom, they read as slightly magical but the person hiring them just says that the queen is superstitious and these stones will form a protective barrier and ease her mind. ""Coincidentally"" the comet that passes by every decade and can be seen in the night sky currently suddenly seems to be getting brighter as its progress along its path has stopped. The four points have created a target for the comet, centering it directly on the castle.
25. Bandits have been attacking wealthy merchants and stealing their wares. Stop them. Except that this is an undercover scheme from the Baron to stop weapons shipments to rebels in his lands.
26. The blacksmith's daughter has been kidnapped by goblins. Rescue her from the ancient temple. Except that the BBEG has been searching for this temple for years as it holds great power. The goblins found it, and he refused to pay them, hence the kidnap.
27. A troll has moved into the mine, remove it. Except that the miners had discovered his scheme. Now they are dead, he wants to resume critical mining operations.
28. You are hired to protect a rich noble who has set up an organization to stop illegal slave trafficking, from being killed. Turns out she is the main person responsible for said slave trafficking and the party has just eliminated the people trying to stop her.
29. Party is sent to kill Lich king/queen in a local ruins. They are actually the last line in a very old order meant to keep a portal to the nine hells sealed. He became undead so his watch will be eternal.
30. The PCs are tasked with destroying a pirate fleet. The pirates are actually trying to sabotage the local slave trade.
31. The cure for the king's illness is in an ancient dungeon full of monsters only someone strong can get past, and behind a magic barrier that only someone good can open (super-bland quest). But, there is a second barrier after the cure, and if the party is curious or greedy they unleash an evil that teleports out to cause havoc."

40. Medical Spray (painlessly cauterizes wounds for a small number of hit points.)

41. Mental Enhancement Nasal Spray (Street name Graymatter - advantage on Intelligence-based rolls for eight hours. After each use, make an increasingly difficult Wisdom saving throw to avoid becoming addicted. Once addicted, the spray loses its benefits and must be taken to avoid ongoing penalties to Strength and Dexterity.)

42. Physical Enhancement Sub-dermal Steroid (Street name Rhino - advantage on Strength-based rolls for eight hours. After each use, make an increasingly difficult Constitution saving throw to avoid becoming addicted.

44. Fiber-optic micro-spider-drone; drags a hair-thin (but relatively durable) fiber-optic cable for up to 15 km, thru any hole or opening larger than 5 millimeters in diameter.  The spider may be fitted with an optical device, or some other data-gathering system.  The spider may also be fitted with an automated splice and amplification system, but can then only fit through openings larger than 25 mm.  Travels at 10 cm per second, speed is halved in liquid.  Works in water up to 100 m of depth, and in any temperature range between -40 C and up to 80 C.  Hacking into the secured fiber channel by hostile actors is somewhat easy to detect, and the fiber is resistant to noise or interference. 

45. Man-portable Muon backscatter Detector Array - see through a meter of lead or up to 10 meters of stone or concrete.  The unit weighs about 50 kg, and so is technically ""man-portable"", and it isn't particularly high frame rate (a single shot takes 15 minutes) or high resolution either, but it is stealthy and emits no radiation.

46. Electronic Suite Goggles, Glasses, or Contacts (can see in multiple light spectrums.  Useful for detecting laser security systems.  Auto mapper so you don't get lost.  Heads up display of notes.  Useful for pass codes or information on various targets or security systems.)  
  
47. Glass Cutting Tool (suction cups to a glass surface, cutter quickly and quietly makes a circular hole large enough to put your arm in.  Can cut through 1/2 inch thick glass in about 10 seconds.  May or may not work if the glass is thicker.)

52. Subliminal Message Sticky Speaker (Adheres to nearly any surface.  Broadcast a message just outside of normal hearing range, that influences people without them realizing it.  It's not exactly mind control, but it can make the target or security more predictable.)

54. Sticky tracer: Small geo-tracer that adheres to the target, as popularized by Spider-Man

55. Micro-meals: Dense, nutrition-packed rations that expand while chewed to be more satisfying than mere nutrient pills

56. Omni-antidote: Neutralizes most poisons

57.  Battery-powered Sawz-All with active noise cancellation

58. Self-spreading super-lubricant.  On a floor, it's a tripping hazard.  On a road, it's a crash hazard.  On skin, adds a bonus to Escape Artist rolls or to defending against grappling."
345,"Hey Reddit,

I've making a list of genres that can be mixed and matched to create new and unique setting. 

I want to do this for two reasons, 1 I frequently play D&D and want to experiment and create new settings and worlds to build and play in. And 2, I want to create new unique settings for my creative writing.

The desiccated husks left by the spider enrich the soil for the tree, eventually leading to the formation of additional stump traps. The largest wild examples recorded sported a massive central tree with a surrounding field in excess of 200 stumps.

63. a herd of dire boar"
348,"There's a huge, (magi)technologically advanced city that was abandoned centuries ago. It's since become the capital city of a new empire, but most of the city, outside of the walled-off high security areas, remains a hostile wasteland where you're as likely to get eaten by a wild animal as you are to simply disappear after getting hit by some malfunctioning long-forgotten piece of technology. Life is harsh out here. It draws a lot of inspiration from the game Kenshi in its mood, although not necessarily in its aesthetics. What kind of encounters could travelers have with other people there? I'd prefer species-agnostic entries, i.e. not writing about elves or dwarves but just people, if possible!

1. Psychotic bandits are looking to prey upon the next caravan of traders to sate their empty stomachs.

2. A group of traders tries to remain undetected. They're very shifty, especially about their pack animals and their cargo and will turn hostile if the players try to inspect either. Because they're shipping drugs. 

3. A member of an indigenous tribe distracts the players with an amazing trade deal while his buddies try to pickpocket the party.

4. An old man wanders towards you, warning of ""the fog"" and the creatures that inhabit it. He says it's right behind him, but there's nothing there. 

5. A woman is in the middle of taming a gigantic arthropod that looks like it's about to eat her! If she's left alone, she succeeds, climbs on its back and takes it home. If the players help, she might even offer them a ride. But if the players attack the arthropod, she'll join it in fighting the party."
349,"1. David Manson. True Neutral mimic that learned to take human form and is now attempting to fit in with other humans.
2. Enigma. Chaotic Neutral Non-Binary Doppelganger. Is currently going through an identity crisis and has taken up adventuring as a way of coping.
3. Boris the Seer. Chaotic Neutral old human man who claims to see the future. Is unclear if he can actually do this or if he's just high on drugs.
4. Dixie the Pixie. Chaotic Good female pixie. Follows adventuring parties and writes soppy fanfictions based on their adventures.
5. Ware-Wolf. True Neutral awakened wolf. A traveling merchant who wanders the kingdom selling assorted oddities. Is known by his catchphrase, ""Ware-Wolf has wares, if you have coin""."

351,"My players are entering a pyramid stolen by a mad Amethyst Greatwyrm. Each room is in a different dimension and I'd like a mechanical/fluff effects for each room.

1. A room where spell-casters can manifest their spell slots and trade them to other casters.
2. A hallway where gravity is extra strong and all characters gain spider-walk.
3. A room where each character is split in two. Both copies share HP and use the same action pool.
4. An echoing room where each round is still visible, as a transparent illusion, for the next 1d4 rounds.
5. Magically charged room where all spells are cast as if one level higher.
6. You find a sphinx that wants the party to ask her a riddle she’s never heard of. She will only let you out of the room if she’s satisfied with the riddle, whether she guesses it or not. (thanks)
Thanks for the following suggestions:
7. Entropic Acceleration: Any creature performing more than one attack roll this round, or moving more than half their movement speed suffers Nd4 fire damage (where N is the number of attacks, or the number of squares moved in excess of half speed, divided by 2, minimum 1). 
8. 1% Compound Interest - every round each character finds 1d100 ""crimps"" (1/100th of a CP, 50 crimp = 1 pound) in their pockets. (simplified and split, hope you don't mind)
9. Necrotic aura - Each round each character loses 1d4 hp and it's HP maximum is reduced by same amount. Reduction lasts for 1 month or until a greater restoration spell is used.
10. Brownian Motion: At the end of each of your turns, roll a d4. You must move your character to an unoccupied square at least that many squares away. You are considered to have moved through any intervening squares. This movement triggers attacks of opportunity.
11. Benefit of Experience: Gain one temporary level of experience and all its benefits. At the end of this effect, you and all your maximum stats revert to their original values.
12. Benefits of Hindsight: If you move this round, you are blinded. Any item or creature that moves this round is considered to be invisible for the duration of the round. But, you gain advantage on any Int or Wis checks. Stand still to see.
Thanks to:
13. Pitch Black: room in total darkness, light sources (magical & mundane) don’t work, darkvision ineffective. Make the floor uneven, with a few pit traps, low ceilings in places, slanted walls.
14. Grow/Shrink: every round in this room each creatures height changes by +d6 -d6 inches (if medium size, suggest d8’s if large, d4’s if small, d2’s if tiny). Magic armour & clothes vary so they still fit properly, mundane items don’t change size. Could be permanent size change or maybe returns to normal over the next month.
Thanks to-Lee-Gio:
15. A room that appears to have a different shape and number of doors for every PC.
16. a room where every PC sees and hears every other party member as a mirror image of themselves at different ages.
17. a room where every PC must walk backward.
18. a room where each PC must exit after a different number of round, decided on a d6 roll.
thanks to:
19. The never-ending hallway: no matter how long they walk down the hallway they never get to the end. However if they turn around and try walking the other way, they never get to end. If they step backwards, they are at end of hallway.
20. The Bottomless Pit. They are ""falling"" forever. Actually they are hovering inches above floor and a stiff wind is keeping them aloft. But it is dark , so they cannot tell. and darkvision does not work.
21. Fluid Light. Light acts like a fluid in this room. As creatures and players move through the room, they leave a 'wake' behind them, causing obfuscation walls in the squares they move through. Could also doing something like prismatic spray (weakened) if they attack or cause a 'disturbence' in the fluid light. Think of it like splashing someone in a pool.
22. 

Let me hear what else you have, thanks!"

1. Employees are complaining about lack of pay. I've a business to run here. How do they expect me to run this without any employees?
2. Accident today, thankfully nobody was hurt. Not sure what caused that boulder to fall. Thankfully Joseph noticed the rock moving before it finally tipped to far and came crashing down.
3. Nasty weather today. Busy working with the employees to ensure we don't have any flooding.
4. Cursed? I am getting tired of the locals saying this place/area is cursed. Its just coincidence and random events that keep occurring. If they focus on only the negative then of course its going to seem cursed.

Part of the route is cleared, but not enough for her or anyone else to fit through. We've started combing the surrounding area trying to find them.
6. Not sure if fresh blood is really needed for the ritual. The book claims that blood used by the one casting the spell would empower it more, but I don't want to tie my actual life force to the spell. Maybe I can use animal blood instead and just write the glyphs by hand.
7. The ritual didn’t work. I’m not sure if it’s because it wasn’t my blood, or if 7 squirrels wasn’t enough. That warlock that came through town assured me that 7 was a significant magical number, so I thought that it would do the trick. My employees won’t like being asked to catch more. (From Particular-Coffee-34)
8. That half elf keeps saying I’m his dad. Definitely not mine. Have you seen those ears??? Not gonna get one measly copper piece from me (from Lord_Gibby).
9. That tavern had the best dinner I’ve ever had after a long day of adventuring. If the rumors are true and it’s actually Troll meat that they carve off bits every night aren’t dissuading me either! I’m going back! (From Lord_Gibby)
10. Found a strange rock in the woods today. Looks like there's a man carved into it. Will investigate tomorrow. (From UmbramonOrSomething)
11. 
I've heard rumors of werewolves, but I don't think any will come for this town. If they do, the hunter will sho (line trails off). From mbramonOrSomething)"

358,"A list of sci-fi touches for a bar/restaurant that characters might visit in a Traveller or Stars Without Number game. There's already a few d100 lists about space food, so I am hoping to cover decor and technology, e.g., things about the look and feel of the place, not cuisine. Things that will show that the characters aren't in 1930s Kansas anymore.

If sufficiently advanced science is indistinguishable from magic, I should also be able to convert this into a high fantasy list, too.

I am going to make this a d66 list (two d6 rolls), because I think we have enough good ideas.

\##d66 sci-fi touches for a tavern/restaurant/starport bar

1. The decor features thousands of jewel-bugs that shine with a magical iridescence under UV light. They live in a large, dangerous **decorative tank full of fluorine gas** to match their homeworld's insidious atmosphere.
2. The decor features [**immensely disturbing oversized chairs**]( **from an alien spacecraft**, along with the fossilized remains of an immense xeno/exomorph.
3. **The servers are (choose one: polite, amusing, slightly-off, more-human-than-human, or AI-equipped) androids** that have either (a) seen things you people wouldn't believe, (b) are dramatically overqualified for the job, (c) are fluent in six million forms of communication, or are (d) on loan to the restaurant.
4. **Holojectors and scent synthesizers** evoke the open plains of another world.
5. **Dishes are cleared (efficiently|clumsily|less than efficiently) by autonomous floating drones,** or maybe vaguely humanoid robots, supplied by a megacorporation as a cybernetics showcase.
6. **The dining room is a climate-controlled wonder,** full of fragrant plants, blossoming flowers, and robotic songbirds from the distant alien world that inspired the restaurant's cuisine.
7. Patrons must take a grav car to **the restaurant, which floats over the world** on a gravitics platform. \/joyofsovietcooking\]. Optional: The floor is made of transparent superglass, which may induce vertigo in those without piloting or zero-g expertise \/zlos801\].
8. **The waitstaff includes a squad of clones**–at different ages, but genetically identical. The owner says they're free sophonts; the wait staff won't discuss it.
9. The **storeroom's low berths/cold sleep chambers,** meant for rare livestock, are rumored to hold bodies (hostages? enemies? – no one asks questions) stored there by rebels, alien gangsters, or ordinary decent criminals.
10. There's a **dance floor built on a gravitics** platform, for all sorts of zero-g acrobatics.
11. There's a problem in the kitchen, so the only meals available are from the **backup** [**autochef**]( **designed for frugal starship captains**.
12. **Hanging over the bar is a picture** of Capt. Anlaagegish Kasongo, who visited several planets in the sector 250 years ago. According to local records, which are pretty good, the visits all happened within a few days – meaning that Kasongo must have had a hyperspace wormhole drive (or whatever).
13. The entire venue is **built around a grove of exotic alien trees** that are sacred under local superstition/religion. Over years, their beautiful and iridescent trunks have grown through the restaurant's walls and ceilings.
14. **On the menu are the Four Space Delicacies** traditionally served at royal feasts under the old Galactic Empire: water from an Oort Cloud comet, steaks cut from a spacewhale, soup made from the bladder of a gas giant floater, and the sweetbreads of an xeno/exo/cryptomorph.
15. The ship carrying comestibles for the kitchen is overdue, and chef must make do with cloned starbeest and  local groat meat.
16. The ship carrying a cargo comestibles for the kitchen is overdue, and the kitchen must make do with local starbeest and groat meat.
17. The decor features **dozens of photos, painting, and holos of the subsector's most famed  pilots.** One image shows a grinning, mustachioed young man in a flight suit. Under the image, you notice an older man, with the same moustache and flight suit, sitting alone. He grins at you, raises his empty glass and gestures, hopefully \/Arkenstihl\].
18. The **cocktail umbrellas are holographic emitters** that project minuscule islands, sailboats, dolphins, surfers, etc. that float on the surface of your drink \/Zadder\].
19. Rooms in the attached hotel are equipped with the **Spiritual Omnibus, an e-reader loaded with thousands of religious texts** from across the galaxy, courtesy of the Interstellar Gideons \/Zadder\].
20. A cooler behind the bar holds special non-water ice cubes that are only to be used with one particular liquor on the shelf. **Using regular ice would cause a cataclysmic chemical reaction** \/Zadder\].
21. **A gambler has been sitting at the same card table for weeks**, on one hell of a winning streak. Casual observers don't know that its an android planted there to drum up customers \/Zadder\].
22. **Every beverage served at the restaurant looks to be a glass of plain water**, but actually tastes exactly like what the character ordered. The staff won't comment. \/eDaveUK\].
23. The **AI-driven karaoke machine** in the corner knows every song for every species in Charted Space, and what it doesn't know it can learn. The backing track, however, will always be slightly out of tune \/Aquashinez\].
24. On staff is a **bedraggled android bouncer** used in bar fights to entertain drunken idiots. Missing a limb, and occasionally short-circuiting, it will engage the players, should they get drunk and fight. But with average human stats, the droid will do no damage \/Aquashinez\].
25. The **restaurant is a converted cargo shuttle**. Everyone has a different story about what the shuttle used to transport. \/zlos801\].
26. The entire business–front and back of the house–is **run by a single AI** that controls robot bouncers, servers, cooks, and bartenders \/zlos801\].
27. The **decor features taxidermied animals** from various planets in the sector. Many of these beasts are on the menu \/World_of_Ideas\].
28. After touching a scanner, **menu holograms appear over your table** depicting all the restaurant's offerings that are considered safe for your species \/World_of_Ideas\].
29. Airlocks lead to well-appointed **private rooms for diners from worlds with corrosive, exotic, or insidious atmospheres**, or species from planets with exceptionally low or high gravity  \/World_of_Ideas\].
30. **Booths feature holographic privacy screens** and the **stage has a holographic entertainment system** \/World_of_Ideas\].
31. The decor features **antiques evoking the hard-bitten days of early space travel**, like obsolete asteroid mining lasers, outmoded mecha-like hostile environment suits, retro robots crafted out of bronze, along with astrolabes, telescopes, and antique globes of strange worlds \/World_of_Ideas\].
32. Every joint in every starport served by the Spacer's Guild has one: **a drink named after the last ship lost in space when passing through the system**. This place has three: the ""Hyperspace Merchant Vessel Beowulf"",  after a long-haul ultra-trader lost 7 standards ago with 377 souls; the ""Wujing Zongyao You Ting-362"", a customs cutter (botched search-and-rescue); and the ""Hyperion Corporation Market Research Vessel 464-A"", lost six standards ago (reactor breach and explosion following a biological outbreak). \/MaxSizeIs\].
33. **The rest room–if that's what it is**–features a bewildering array of nozzles, vacuums, chemical tanks, sinks, oddly placed holes (e.g., at floor level, on pedestals, in the walls), demi-partitions, and cubicles. Grit your teeth and pick one \/Arkenstihl\].
34. You stumble and hear a pained shout. An alien quickly **pulls back its tail/wing/tentacle/pseudopod** and throws a bowl of space nuts at you \/Arkenstihl\].
35. You get your drinks. As you take the tray of steaming glasses, a horrified server takes two back, saying that those were **meant for the aliens in the corner and would have absolutely been fatal for humans**. They return with new drinks, no steam, and thank you for your patience \/Arkenstihl\].
36. The decor features a psionic-driven **holojector that manifests faces and scenes from the memories** of people in the restaurant \/Arkenstihl\].

359,"Whether you have a beloved NPC in the witness protection program or an old PC who has decided to put their adventuring days behind them, it's likely that characters will eventually go off to start a completely new life somewhere else. So this list is intended to come up with what new lives those characters might end up pursuing instead! I put their find-ability in this lifestyle as well in case the party might be interested in finding the NPC/PC again later in the campaign.

1. Shepherd of (sheep/goats/cattle) in a large secluded pasture, making them a little harder to contact again without a bit of searching.
2. Worker on a fishing boat that's often out at sea, able to be found easily as their boat always returns to the same port on the coast after a week or two.
3. Hawker / Merchant of their looted wares, selling all the swords and possibly cursed amulets that they'd obtained with the party and living off the money made from that. Likely are stationed somewhere in a region's market district, not too hard to find.
4. Wanderer that travels from tavern inn to tavern inn, sharing stories of their ventures with other patrons and living off their own savings for now. If they keep to a region, easy to find, if they wander across country, can be traced by rumors and asking barkeeps.
5. Grifter / Gambler that's similar to the wanderer, but intends to keep their pockets full and their mouth shut. While they might not spread their stories much, they might be able to be traced when others talk about the stunts and scams they pulled.
6. Charity volunteer/worker that makes their living off what the charity gives them, spending most of their time working for the cause and caring for others. Pretty stationary, and easier to find again.
7. Upper Class Schmoozer, essentially lingers around the wealthy and affluent, and through charm and skill they manage to live off of invitations to stay at vacation homes and in guests rooms. All the while attending some of the fanciest parties in the citadel and sneaking coin in their own direction. Who knows how long they can keep it up, but it seems to be doing well for now. A little hard to find access to them as they're in richer circles, but generally stay in the same tight-knit region to keep close to the affluent.
8. General Laborer that helps in the unloading of cargo from merchant ships or heavy supplies to merchant stalls in the marketplace. There's many laborers in a market area, so it might be a little tricky to find them, but asking a few of the right people will likely lead you to them.
9. Chicken farmer. Simple as can be, they don't move from their little plot of land much. Easy to find again.
10. Lorekeeper in a library/Lyceum. After seeing world events unfold  firsthand they want to be there to record more and make sure the record  is kept straight. Depending on the size of the institution they could be easy or difficult to find, but could be a good resource for new  adventurers to seek out.
11. Inn Keeper Pretty stationary and should be easy to find.
12. Elite imperial guard/ General- Thanks to their experience and combat  expertise they are best suited for all manner of treats and  unpredictable situations.
13. Guild Teacher / Trainer - Teacher who shapes new minds and bodies of future protectors, scholars or  performers. Maybe they have created their own school and care for youth  of the world.
14. Circus performer.  Throwing knives never earned them this much attention in combat. Cheers  of the crowd sure are nice when you are 10 meters above ground doing backflips.
15. Artist
16. Novelist
17. Yoga Instructor
18. Merchant ship Captain.
19. Captain of the City Watch.
20. Store keeper.
21. Guild master.
22. Temple high priest.
23. Advisor to the ruling elite.
24. Travelling minstrel.
25. Recluse. Either in a cave, deep in the woods, or in the bottommost parts  of the city sewers. Or perhaps they hide in plain sight as a simple  commoner. They're hard to find, and they love it that way. They're tired  of solving problems and saving the world, and they've retired  thankyouverymuch. They may also pack up and leave to a different  secluded location if they're worried that someone is close to finding  them.
26. Adrenaline junkie. They miss the drama of adventuring and have a hard  time adjusting to non-adventuring life. For whatever reason, they can't  adventure at the moment, and so they seek  extreme/risky/life-threatenting entertainment in some other way.
27. Politician- using the wealth and reputation they built up over the  years, they decided to get more politically active. Whether that means being the mayor of a smaller town or sitting on the city council of a larger city. Maybe a king they had worked for has rewarded them by  bringing them on as a “royal advisor” or granted them a governorship.
28. Story teller. Telling detailed, non-embroidered stories of their friends  so people can enjoy them, yet leaving themselves out because they wish  to avoid the spotlight/don't want to be asked to become an adventurer again.
29. Barkeep,  at a (d6):  1. seedy district brawling bar; 2. power broker's public  house; 3. crossroads caravansarai cantina; 4. merchant district  roadhouse; 5. scholars saloon; 6. theater district taproom.
30. Lighthouse keeper.
31. Groundskeeper  of (d6): 1. A graveyard with some terrible inhabitants; 2. The garden  of a palace; 3. A public garden containing a monument with a secret; 4.  The resting place of a prince or princess under a curse; 5. orphanage;  6. school for wizardry.

361,"So, [dungeonpunk]( in my eyes, is basically a setting describer where magitech either replaces, or is equal to, the level of regular technology. Common examples include Arcane, FF7, Eberron, and others. The world I'm building is basically modern in terms of tech level/analogues, though I imagine this list would be of use to anyone who wants a setting with a high degree of magitech. It was tough to decide if what to flair this with, but either way, with my few examples, I'm going for a dark comedy/satire vibe, although that's not required for yours!

1. Potions are sold in vending machines.
2. Magic schools and adventuring academies are more like universities. Wizards graduate with student loans and the turn over is pretty high because of the danger. Occupational licensing is required for most people to legally adventure.
3. Gods work a lot like the stock market. X amount of prayers are promised to Y god in exchange for Z miracles. The Mount Olympus of the setting looks a lot like Wall St or a corporate boardroom.
4. Necromancers have a lot of power in the setting due to figuring out how to do magic with oil
5. Ectoplasm is sold in gummies or pills as a supplement for creatures that subsist on souls.
6. Magic items are mass manufactured by various companies, often for the military.
7. Humans conquered the realms of the celestials and/or fiends, forcing them to migrate to the material plane, and their morality becomes less innate.
8. The Nine Hells become a corporation.
9. Clerics and/or warlocks become streamers to raise awareness of their gods and/or patrons.
10. The internet sort of exists, as a connection to a massive tree.
11. The internet sort of exists, as a connection from crystal ball-like structures and the afterlife.
12. Parties without clerics, or the rich, can pay for one from a life insurance agency to follow them around. Also, one of these agencies' most expensive plans can assist you in becoming a lich.
13. People donate corpses to the local alchemist guild, in exchange for money. They can also pay to test out new potions.
14. The black market for magical weapons is bustling. /marshallsp1
15. Magic train heists  /marshallsp1
16. Sewers are dangerous. Some are flooded with arcane waste from corporations, corrupting and twisting any animals that find themselves down there  /marshallsp1
17. Rogue alchemists sell drugs and potions to the poor; some people develop addictions  /marshallsp1
18. There's an equivalent to swiss banks, with keys coded to your own personal pocket dimension. (of course, they provide their client's valuables with security, and the highest level of discretion).  /marshallsp1
19. The rich hire designer alchemists to make their party drugs /marshallsp1
20. Vampire nightclub  /marshallsp1
21. Some bards play in bands, some can manipulate sound without instruments (ADM- Arcane dance music)  /marshallsp1
22. Wizards can live forever and accumulate incredible wealth and power /marshallsp1
23. City guards and corporate enforcers wear magic-reducing armor and wield shields/arcane batons /marshallsp1
24. Fascist-lite hostile foreign government conducts secret Necromantic research to generate super-soldier army. /MaxSizeIs
25. Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, James Thomson, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Nikola Tesla, Giles Gilbert Scott, or Christopher Wren with the serial numbers filed off. /MaxSizeIs
26. Goggles, corsets, and outfits that are basically belts everywhere. /MaxSizeIs
27. The Illuminati, but with magic, and at least 3 other organizations that think the Illuminati are hacks, but are just as secretive and powerful. /MaxSizeIs
28. At least 3 levels of ancient fallen magitek civilizations, stacked on top of each other, over thousands of years, with the new, current one, only just now approaching the ""glory"" of the previous platinum, gold, and silver-ages, ""digging too deeply, and greedily /MaxSizeIs
29. ""Promethians"": a secret society of ""rational thinkers"" aiming to overturn society and using advanced magitek or ""heretical"" techniques to do so.  /MaxSizeIs
30. The Napoleonic Wars, but with Magitek, and Sean Bean/Ioan Gruffudd/Russel Crowe knockoffs. /MaxSizeIs
31. Kickass Magic Airships, Dirigibles, and Zeppelins everywhere.  /MaxSizeIs
32. Black market magic item shops selling stolen or looted magical-tek pulled up from the depths of dank dungeons. /MaxSizeIs
33. Spells leave traces, allowing magical fingerprinting. /LucidFir
34. Astral projecting into the Erdtree internet leaves you vulnerable to body contol by malevolent entities. /LucidFir
35. ""Hackers"" in this setting refer to those who can graft limbs and other body parts from other creatures. Want night vision? Kill a cat. Want infravision and have no morals? Kill an orc, or an elf.  /LucidFir
36. Given that divine favour is tradable as in the stock market, minor celebrities use any means to gather followers (ala instagram) to then bargain exposure for power. The result is basically a warlock who isn't tied to a single patron but has to please their viewers and avoid being cancelled.  /LucidFir
37. In some regions curses such as vampirism and lycanthropy are considered as disabilities and the progressive governments provide safe places and social systems to help. In other places you get East Hastings, Vancouver, but with wild magic and werewolves and potion addicts.  /LucidFir"

364,"# Encounters for when the party infiltrating the enemy's city.

1. The party comes across a group of enemy soldiers who are torturing a captured NPC. The party can choose to try and rescue the NPC or ignore them. If the party tries to rescue the NPC, they must make a series of Stealth and Persuasion checks to get close enough to the enemy forces. The DC for the checks starts at 12 and increases by 2 for every success. If the party fails any of the checks, they are spotted and must fight their way out. If the party is successful, they rescue the NPC.
2. The party comes across a group of enemy soldiers patroling the area. The party can choose to try and avoid them or engage them. If the party tries to avoid them, they must make a series of Stealth checks to get past the patrols. The DC for the checks starts at 10 and increases by 2 for every success. If the party fails any of the checks, they are spotted and must fight their way out. If the party is successful, they avoid the patrols.
3. The party comes across a group of enemy soldiers who are resting and not on patrol. The party can choose to try and attack them while they are resting or ignore them.
4. A rogue enemy soldier noticed the party and is trying to escape to warn the others. The party can choose to try and stop him or let him go. If the party tries to stop him, they must make a series of Athletics and Perception checks to catch up to him.
5. City guards patrol marches down the street. The patrol comprises of 1d10+5 soldiers. The party can choose to try and avoid them or engage them
6. The party encounters 1d6 bandits who have killed some soldiers and put on their gear. They attempt to shake down the party for ""taxes"".
7. The party passes a bar outside of which a drunkard makes a scene, yelling at passersby and trying to start fights. He could blow the party's cover if he's not careful...
8. A thief approaches the party in a hurry, joins the group, and urges them to play along. Shortly thereafter, 1d4+1 guards run up and ask the party if they saw a thief pass this way.
9. The party enters the city to see some villagers being put to death for speaking out against the bbeg publicly and trying to revolt
10. A caravan of captured slaves for his salt mines. It’s poorly guarded, but they may not be able to kill the guards without alerting the rest of his army.
11. The BBEG’s secret police are conducting patrols looking for the party.
12. The BBEG’s regular police are beating up street children.
13. A church is being burnt to the ground by the secret police for “sheltering dissedents”.
14. A pyramid of human and demihuman skulls.
15. The party overhears low-level goons talking about a previous battle the players won against some of the BBEG’s men. The story is largely accurate but told from the perspective that the players are the villains. 
16. The party encounters a hunter while out in the BBEG's realm. Are they a poacher who could help, or a sentinel of the BBEG?
17. Trying to infiltrate through the sewers, the party encounters a band of goblins. Will they risk a loud fight or try another way?
18. The party is greeted warmly, just as everyone else is, when passing through the city gate. They are given some directions, pamphlets about local wonders and shops, and small bracelets that are to beautiful to throw away.
19. The party, while scouting the city, spots a couple trying to elope by roping down the walls. Will they use them as distraction or help them?
20. The party is searched for weapons and questioned upon entering. Will they be able to hide who they are?
21. A raven and a pixie note everyone entering the city. Sometimes the raven caws, and the visitors are led away, sometimes the pixie ask seemingly nonsensical questions."
365,"Original Thread: 

1. Silent incorporeal creatures approach to drain your life. They cower and avoid bright light.

2. You hear an enormous creature hunting nearby. If you're lucky and don't do anything stupid, it might not find you.

3. An endless skittering horde of vermin approaches. They will stop and swarm around any object from the Prime, and area damage slows them. Your best chance is to flee.

4. Invisible necrotic winds blow, a howling tempest of negative energy that tears at living creatures and light sources while leaving plants and inanimate objets unscathed. They drain the life from anyone who does not seek shelter.

5. Terrible memories of living creatures from the Prime Material Plane play out in the form of whispering shadows.

6. A traveling shadar-ki merchant passes by, hoping to find some new wares.

7. A drow spy passes by, seeking a portal to the Underdark.

8. A traveling archmage passes by, they are merely curious about who you are and how you got here.

9. A band of lost undead slayers pass by, they are beginning to go mad. They argue among themselves whether your party are deceitful monsters in disguise.

10. The black sands of this dsert slowly drain the color and energy from your limbs. Some unknown group built a chain of barrel-sized clockwork devices of silver and crystal, spaced half an hour apart in a path through the desert. Hand-cranking a device produces a bubble of positive energy that makes rest possible, but you dream of dry raspy claws tearing at your skin.

11. As you pass through the misty woods, you hear a cry for help in the distance. It sounds like someone is being murdered!

12. Travel is uneventful, but for many hours you can faintly hear the sound of a young girl sobbing. You can never tell where it's coming from.

1. A shadowy figure appears out of the corner of your eye, but when you look it's gone. This keeps happening, and each time it is getting closer. /awesomebanana31

1. You find a tavern! Most of the occupants are rather polite undead creatures, and the owner is a necrochef who skillfully prepares humanoid flesh for customers (who must capture and bring their own meat). There are cages with live people in the back, but both the and the customers will take a dim view of stealing their property. /angelofxcost 

1. A blinding dust storm carries the shades of the past, still fighting a cacophanous long-forgotten war. /Sapphirice 

1. A mostly-intact city lies empty, with only a handful of shadow-creatures living within.

Records written after its arrival in the Shadowfell reveal its inhabitants succumbed to a slow corruption of both minds and bodies. /Sapphirice

1. An unusually bright beacon is seen in the distance. When you approach you find a mage's tower surrounded with wards to keep it protected from the eternal night. /Sapphirice

1. The party is approached by a curious group of mangy deer-like creatures. Close inspection reveals pointed teeth and an appetite for flesh. /Searaph72

1. A shadow dragon flies overhead. Perhaps it didn't notice you? niversalruin

1. You stumble upon a vampire lord's vacation home. They're in the middle of a high-drama family reunion. /CMDR_Wazowski 

1. A barren and desolate mountain appears on the horizon before you. No matter which way you turn, you look up again to see it's still there in front of you. Eventually it grows close, looming over you. /ElectricParasite

1. This woodland area has clammy, moist, sweet-smelling air. The trees are soft and wet to the touch, they look almost swolen. A human skull protrudes from one of the trees. /Git777

1. You come across a small log cabin in the woods. It is unsettling, but it appears to be warm and dry. /Git777

1. As you cross the desert, you hear a scraping, rushing noise. As you crest the next sand dune, you see a gigantic sand worm rushing pass, oblivious to your presence. /Git777

1. A Monolith of grey stone bears a cryptic warning. ""None are so blind that they cannot see the twisting tower and the darkness of this place. Look not upon the face of the weeping one, Tread not on the bones of mad men."" /Git777

1. The party meets a sad robed figure, a stunningly beautiful shadar-kai who claims to have partial amnesia. She is actually a succubus in disguise, looking to recruit more souls to serve her. /Git777

1. Everyone awakes in a panic! You don't remember setting up camp, yet here you are, in your bedroll as you usually would be. Everyone has had a long rest. All of your bags and packs are in a neat pile, every strap undone and mouth untied and pouch opened. Nothing seems to have been stolen. /Git777

1. The party finds a necropolis, it is crawling with powerful undead. /Git777

1. The Party find a corpse still grasping an axe embedded in a tree. Its eyes and mouth filled with dirt. /Git777

1. A statue of an androgynous human in a classic style. Several parts are damaged and stained. On closer examination, the stained parts are dozens of tiny overlapping faces bulging out from the cracks in the stone. /Git777

1. You come across a crypt the size of a house. Its entrance has been sealed with thick glass, the space beyond seems to be full of brackish water. /Git777

1. You find the ruined walls of a forgotten structure. In one corridor is a deep hole stuffed with giant-sized bones, seemingly only a few years old. /Git777

1. The clouds churn like boiling water, and blood-red rain begins to fall. It burns like acid! /Git777

1. Crippling melancholy grips the party, mustering the strength to do anything takes heroic effort. Those worst afflicted can't even stand. /Git777

1. A flat, featureless plain holds hundreds of zombies standing staring at the sky. They are completely indifferent to the party, but if one is injured all of them will become hostile. /Git777

1. A corroded copper dome protrudes from the ground, one side of it has collapsed to reveal a structure beneath. A long drop into darkness appears to lead to a buried library. /Git777

1. A vast seemingly-abandoned structure. One of its rooms contains a teleportation circle that can return you to the Prime Material Plane. /Git777

1. The party meets a merchant whose face always changes to match the individual they are talking to. Will buy items from the party, but wants to pay with human teeth. /Git777

1. A twisted helix-shaped tower rises from an obsidian plinth, with no obvious entrance. It seems to be composed of the spines of colossal creatures. It hums with sinister energy. Anyone who touches it feels invigorated, and for a time they perceive undead creatures as beautiful and living creatures as hideous. /Git777

1. A field of bones stretches out before you. Black worms twist and writhe between the skeletons. /Git777

1. You find a naked corpse stretched out atop a boulder-sized skull. Apparently they plucked out their own eyes and are smiling contentedly. Some adventuring gear has been discarded nearby. /Git777

1. The valley ahead is littered with heaps of bones. If you approach, hungry oozes begin crawling from the piles. /Git777

1. The field ahead is strewn with a layer of bones. As you cross, the bones begin to churn and ripple like the tides, and a wave of bones accelerates towards you! /Git777

1. Sitting in the middle of the path ahead is a neat conical pile of humanoid teeth. /Git777

1. The air here is choked with black spores that smell sickly-sweet. The early stages of infection cause greying skin, hallucinations, and uncontrollable laughter. /Git777

1. A massive worm bursts from the earth a hundred yards ahead before diving back into the ground. It is hunting, and it can hear where you are. /Git777

1. A carved stone pillar pokes out of the ashen dunes ahead. If you approach, you realize its carvings resemble the faces of your party. /Git777

1. You find a pool of still, glassy water. It seems to go down forever into blackness. /Git777

1. You find a pool of still water. The first person to touch the water sees the reflection of someone familiar approaching from behind, and then they are thrust in and held beneath the surface by a force that noone else can see. /Git777

1. The ground is broken in several places ahead, grey-blue crystals protrude. Some of the larger ones contain wailing ghostly forms. /Git777

1. You take shelter from a dust storm and find yourself sharing a cave with a motionless figure in a black robe. The first character to touch it or try to attack is zapped by crackling energy and finds themsleves too exhausted to stand, then the figure vanishes in a cloud of smoke. /Git777

1. You come across a black obsidian pyramid etched with runes. Those with the knowledge to read the runes find it is dedicated to an evil deity. There is a wide entrance on one side. /Git777

1. Brown ash snows from the sky. It leaves dark bruises when it touches exposed skin. /Git777

1. A vast field of black roses stretches before you. The thorns draw blood with terrifying ease. /Git777

1. A pack of emaciated dogs circle the party and begin to attack. Anyone bit by one has all of the color drained from their hair. /Git777

1. As you pass through the forest, you are shocked to realize the closest tree is actually a twenty-foot-tall spindly creature sobbing and cradling its head. It responds tersely to anyone who tries to speak with it, and keeps turning to face away and sulk. It will become enraged if anyone beholds its ugly face. /Git777

1. Mist rolls in from the horizon, clinging to the ground. It causes exposed skin to itch and burn. /Git777

1. The party sees an enormous twisted tree on the horizon. As you approach, you get a better look at the thing. It appears to be an entire hamlet liftred hundreds of feet into the air by massive vines. Immobile humanoids are trapped in the vines, twitching and pale. /Git777"

369,"I'm making a rolling table similar to the artifact tables in the Dungeon Master's Guide, for a weapon quality and durability system I'm making. The most expensive and best quality is Masterwork, and costs an intense amount. To offset this, they don't have to roll durability checks, as well as having up to 4 minor benefits. These would be mundane, NOT magical effects, so I'm trying to avoid cloning magical weapons.

1. Perfect balance: this weapon can be used as a finesse weapon
2. Poison Ready: this weapon can hold 3 doses of poison
3. Polished Surface: this shield or armor grants resistance to piercing OR slashing damage
4. Dense Construction: the first attack you make with this weapon deals an additional die of damage
5. Adventurer's Favorite: you do not have to doff this armor to benefit from a long rest
6. Spiked: this armor or shield allows you to make an unarmed strike and deal 1d4 + STR instead of 1+STR
7. Uncanny- This weapon crits on 7 and 20, but crit fails on 13 and 1 \[/Reltias\]
8. Brutal- When you get a 1 on the damage die for this weapon you may reroll it and take the new total \[/Reltias\]
9. Claspe: this weapon can appear as a cane on bonus action \[/Equivalent-Speaker\]
10. Flashy: a bit fancier than it needs to be.  Gives proficiency (or  expertise) in performance checks to impress people with your martial  skills \[/arguablyhuman\]
11. Folding:  This weapon can fold up to half its normal size.  While folded it grants advantage on concealment checks to hide it. \[/World_of_Ideas\]
12. Insulated: The armor piece protects the wearer from cold effects (but not damage). \[/shiftystylin\]
13. Acid-Resistance: The armor is resistant to acidic effects (such as corrosion from a gelatinous cube) (but not damage). \[/shiftystylin\]
14. Terrifying: makes you proficient (or doubly proficient) in Intimidation while wielded \[/arguablyhuman\]
15. Supernatural Bane (type):  This weapon was forged of a material that  (creature type) is vulnerable to.  This weapon does normal damage to the  specified creature type despite any resistance to normal weapons or  resistance to non-magical weapons. \[/World_of_Ideas\]
16. Non-conductive:  When hitting a target that is cold, electrified, or  hot.  The elemental damage does not transfer through the haft, hilt, or  shaft of the weapon to the wielder.  Also the heat metal spell will only  heat up the striking end of the weapon and will not damage the wielder. \[/World_of_Ideas\]
17. Secret Compartment:  The weapon has a secret compartment in the (haft,  hilt, shaft).  This compartment is large enough to hold 1 potion,  scroll, or other tiny item. \[/World_of_Ideas\]
18. Aerodynamic  /  Balanced for  Throwing:  The weapon can be thrown farther than normal.  Increase  normal range and long range by 20ft \[/World_of_Ideas\]
19. **Feather:** A two-handed or Versatile weapon with *Feather* can be used with only one hand, due to its light weight. \[/NonCoreNova\]
20. **Firearm:** The weapon has  a built-in firearm in the handle, which can be fired as a free action  in combat, dealing 1d10 piercing damage. However, this firearm is  single-shot and takes an action to reload. \[/NonCoreNova\]
21. **Hit or Miss:** This  weapon is sharpened in an intricate and detailed way, which can make it  hard to hit the target correctly sometimes, but experts can strike with  deadly force. The hit dice for this weapon are replaced with 1d20.  Attacks that have Advantage or Disadvantage (due to flanking etc) also  roll damage with advantage/disadvantage respectively. \[/NonCoreNova\]
22. **Serrated:** This weapon  is crafted with a saw-like edge to the blade. Targets hit by this blade  take 1d6 damage at the start of their turn for 1 minute, or until an  action is taken to patch the wound \[/NonCoreNova\]"
370,"In scenario where players accept some job, but game immediately jumps at the time after job is done. Because of some reason their memories from day of work were removed afterwards.

1. Some one with kleptomaniac trait find cursed necklace in his/her pocket.
2. Color of your hair have changed. Upon examining this have happened in magical reasons.
3. Nearest tavern owner is especially rude against you.
4. Your shirt have disappeared.
5. Your weapon have changed to other. It is same type of weapon, but it is definitely different one than one you have been carrying around.
6. You have mage armor spell cast on you for 1d6 hours
7. You are carrying all your metal items and armors in separate of all your other stuff. Not wearing any metal armor.
8. Three ducklings are following you.
9. One of your wors scars have disappeared.
10. You have unfamilar key in your pocket."
371,"Hey! My players are soon going to be heading to the Elemental Plane of Water, to search for a MacGuffin found deep in the Darkened Depths in the Sunken City of R'lyeh, and nothing is really known about the place. So, what better way to ""introduce"" the place than to have a hundred different rumours about the place?

This is the place where Great Cthulhu slumbers, the buildings shift and sway in the currents, and indescribable aberrations call home. Every few thousand years, the city rises up through to the surface of the Plane of Water, wreaking havoc as it rises. The tides turn red and storms rage as it is surfaced, and for months the plane is thrown into disarray. But despite the terrible destruction that is wrought, the people of the Boundless Blue don't have much of a record of the city, as nobody can come close enough to it while it's surfaced to get a good look at it, and certainly nobody is suicidal enough to attempt to brave the rest of the Darkened Depths just for research purposes. But, that doesn't mean that somebody didn't get close enough a hundred thousand years ago to record it, but that tome is collecting dust in a decrepit library somewhere, and now all that remains are the rumors that have filtered through both high and low societies.

# d100 Rumors of the Sunken City of R'lyeh

1. The Sunken City is the shell of a great beast that only surfaces to feed
2. There is untold treasure to be found, the trouble is getting it back out of there
3. All the treasures are cursed
4. The waters down there are poisonous to swim in
5. The water is so thick it's like swimming/breathing in mud
6. There is a current down there that travels directly though to Gehenna, Hades, and then dumping out into the infinite layers of the Abyss.
7. There is no Sunken City, it's just a rumor put forth by the overprotective mums to keep their kids from diving too deep.
8. There is an old Storm Giant on the Isle of dread who knows truth about the Sunken City. \[Modified to fit from: \]
9. There’s no Sunken City, it’s just the tomb of an unfathomable priest of  evil, incomprehensible gods.  No treasures there save what’s left of  your mind and soul. \[ \]
10. They say there's a ""way out"" inside the ruins. A old sailor told me a hero he traveled with took it. \[ \]
11. You can walk around the same pillar all day and never see the same view twice. \[ \]
12. I  once heard a guy talk about these Shaw Goths things that live in the  ruins. Look like big black bubbles, hardly move at all. Said he took a  small one home, but lost it before hitting port. \[ \]
13. Heard there's an old professor named Yoo-Clid who said he's been there. Said it was the ugliest pile of rocks he'd ever seen. \[ \]
14. Heard  that it rises up exactly 2 miles Iceward of the Graveyard of Sails. Those who want to try and find unique artifacts go there after it re-sinks, as there's supposed to be some flotsam left afterwards. \[Modified to fit from: \]
15. Those ruins are old! How old? At least as old as the old man in town, Eyon. But we don't talk about that guy. \[ \]
16. You  can't die in the ruins. Horrible things can happen to you, but you  won't die. My grandfather told me about a traveler who went in, got  found the next day at the edge, just an arm and a head, no heart. Long  blood trail. Somehow managed to crawl hundred of feet without a heart,  died once it got to dry earth again. \[ \]
17. I hear it's the fountain of youth! While there you won't age a day! \[ \]
18. Word  has it there's a lost language all over the ruins. The academy put out a  huge bounty for a clean transcription of all the symbols used in that  ruins (they haven't). \[ \]
19. Them  ruins actually rise up when you say the right words. What words? Damned  if I know. But the reason it rises out randomly every several hundred  years is that someone, somewhere, said something that sounded like those  magic words. And well, R'lyeh a'int that picky. \[ \]
20. The  gods go there to die. Don't believe me? You ever heard of Magush? No?  Of course not, they used to believe in him and now he's dead. Read about  him in the library back when I was young. \[ \]
21. I  hear the academy created all this fake evidence of R'lyeh. Maps,  diagrams, journals. They want to keep the Nautical researchers busy so  they don't find out about their secret shipyards, deep in the mountains. \[ \]
22. Place has no color! Everything is grey. If you stay there too long, you'll start to turn grey too! \[ \]
23. I've been there! Place does strange things to life. Here, let me show you *pulls out a clam shell, but solid iron*  see this? Picked it up off the stones there. It's enough warning for me  to stay clear. (The clam shell is man made, on closer inspection you  can see it was crafted at a forge. Dude just wants to tell a story) \[ \]
24.  An ancient magic was lost in the Sunken City, destroyed by an unknown cataclysm. \[ \]
25. They say that Atlantas sunk in these waters. \[ \]
26. Some say the (insert old important ship) still sails without her crew. \[ 
27. Some nights you can see a red glow deep below the waves \[ \]
28. It is now inhabited by merfolk who hate intruders, and hate the surface world even more \[ \]
29. They  say that every seven years, on a dark night when there is no moon and  even the stars seem dim, the lost city rises to the surface, only to  sink again at first light. \[ \]
30. It  probably never existed, and anyway, the notion that ships just disappear  inside the so-called R'lyeh Triangle is simply hogwash. \[ \]
31. For every day you spend in the Sunken City, an innocent chokes to death on thin air. \[ \]"

4. An insanely strong hydra has made its way out of Hades and has been terrorizing a local fishing village to the point of starvation.

10. Apollo got distracted and forgot to keep pulling the sun across the sky, leaving it blazing hot for much longer than intended.

Sly Flourish has a great article on the use of what he calls ‘relics’ in a D&D game. Essentially, relics are mundane objects imbued with magical power. These can be anything from coins, shoes, gems, jewelry, and other trinkets. Often they are infused with a single spell while also being identifiable and usable by anyone. I usually have any magic users be able to detect that the item is magical and then spend a short rest to identify the properties it has. Once the spell or its charges have been used the item loses the energy and is no longer magical.

I use two categories for relics in my games: Limited Use, and Permanent. Limited Use Relics are either one-time use or only a few charges. These tend to be more powerful spells but since they only get a couple of uses out of it, they shouldn’t break your game. Permanent Relics are usually low-level spells or cantrips that can be used once or a few times per day. I try to include one or two relics in each pile of treasure they find. This way they can get fun magic items more often than once per tier and keep the players from being overpowered. Relics are also a great way to feed lore of the world to your players. How exactly did a (63) celestial thorny rose of guiding bolt get into the dungeon anyways? Or how did the NPC come across a (19) pocket watch that runs backward and will cast time stop once? Lastly, they can help round out any missing roles in the adventuring party.

I use it as a common method for making alien and non-human characters seem much more alien and non-human. I just delete some combination of these items from their culture, or GREATLY change them, to the point of not being, well, human!

It IS from the 90s, and some o the items might be seen as non-PC, currently... so you might need to take them with a grain of salt. The list is impressive.

378,"Each effect will last 1d4 hours unless otherwise specified and will occur each time a spell is cast within the wild magic area 

1. A Ghost Story: a semi ethereal sheet envelopes your body, your appearance becomes a semi transparent sheet with 2 eye holes. Attack rolls on you have disadvantage, you must subtract 1d4 from any melee attack roll or strength check. NPCs will likely be frightened of you
2. Great Pumpkins Curse: you and one other creature of your choice see a vision if a terrifying jack-o-lantern. Bane is cast on you and the other creature 
3. Great Pumpkins Blessing: you and one other creature of your choice see a vision of a whimsical jack-o-lantern. Bless is cast on you and the other creature

379,"100 rooms of a local inn, they can house three, two, or one adventurer. If you want to include a description of the door or name of room that's ok too. Don't be afraid for it to be magical!

1. Warm tones surround this room, along with varnished wooden beams and candles that bring an autumnal sense.
2. The room is decorated in soothing blues, with long draping fabric covering the bed.
3. A simple bed is surrounded by basic furnishings, a chair, table and dresser - the room is still nice however.
4. The room is simple, but comforting. A surprising amount of furniture is in the room, and all of it exudes love and care. You can also tell everything, down to the linen sheets, are handmade.
5. A simple grey room is accentuated with strips of copper, stains of silver, and flecks of gold. Over the bed is a mural that appears to be made of coal but becomes gemstones if you walk up close to it.
6. A storm grey covers most of the wall and floor, somewhat contrasted with a black rug, cushions, and a few black dots that seems to shift as time goes forward.
7. The room is decorated in natural tones of browns and greens, and smells very slightly sweet. A bowl of light, fluffy candy lays on the bed with a note saying, ‘eat me, I’m sweet!’
8. The room seems entirely normal and unremarkable except for a feature wall of rocks, along with a nightstand home to a lump of rock & crystal. (If they examine the rock, they realise it cannot be moved - it is actually a ‘Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals’ that they can use)
9. The room is decorated in shades of green, with a few plants somehow flourishing even without much light. Embellishments of gold give the place class, and a golden stag head hangs on the wall above the headboard of a luxurious bed.
10. A few stained red oil lamps illuminate a dark room, casting everything in a red glow. The corners of furniture are harsh, but the room seems functional.
11. This door is some six inches tall, painted red with a handsome brass doorknob no bigger than the head of a hobnail. The room beyond, reserved for the very littlest guests, features a tiny bed of such solid craftsmanship that it almost makes you jealous you can't sleep in it. \[ /Zadder]( **\]**
12. . This room's walls are painted dark blue, speckled with silvery stars and constellations. The bed is circular -- like the moon, you reckon -- and quite cozy. Standing on the windowsill is an enchanted goblet that catches the moonlight and allows it to be drunk. It fizzes on the tongue, tastes lightly sweet, and gives one pleasant dreams. \[ /Zadder]( \]
13. The room is simple, with a striped bedspread and a small iron goblet on the nightstand. The door needs an iron key to unlock, and the door always crackles slightly when you open it. Every time the players close it there is a 10% chance it vanishes until the next sunrise.
14. You are looking at an endless void of space, there seems to be nothing but blackness. Hanging in space a few steps in front of you is a low circular white bed. (There’s plenty of space in this room!) After an hour of walking, you come to a border - although it is not visible \[ /eDaveUK]( \]
15. It's a rather normal room, with two bedside tables, a closet, and a painting of a rather sad-looking woman. However, there is no conventional bed - instead a massive silk hammock that could fit about 10 lies suspended from the rafters. It holds some blankets and pillows
16. The walls and decorations are all painted a stark white, or a very light shade of grey. Everything is neatly made, to the point of perfection, but the bed is rather hard and uncomfortable. However, what really stands out are the black marks by the nightlight - they count up to 16
17. This rooms ceiling is painted to look like a coral reef from an underwater perspective, it is lovely, but slightly trippy, as the walls make it seem like your underwater too. The bed is comprised of very slippery and slightly damp silks. If you rest there, you move as if underwater for the next 30 minutes of waking/getting up
18. Rough wooden panels with a few narrow gaps partition the larger croft space this room is in, sharing half of a blurry and warped glass window that has been nailed shut. Your neighbor's movements, and farts, waft through the cracks. A detailed examination of the room may reveal a carved rune popular in Thief's Cant *""Low""*, and below it, in the floor, under a loose floorboard, a dead-drop or treasure stash. \[ \]
19. The room is clean, with white-lime washed plaster wall, but only going up halfway to an adult human's chest; the rest of the wall is instead the exposed roof rafters, sloping up until full height only a foot away from the end of the door swing. The wall of the room blocks off the rest of the rafters above. A small tin stove sits in the corner, the slightly rusted and dinged up metal chimney flue runs out to a small opening in the wall. There is a bed sized for a child or halfling, along with a cot trundle bed for an even smaller child beneath it. A full-sized adult might find either bed to a bit small. \[ \]
20. The room on this floor is unusually cold, and everything seems to be covered in a thin layer of frost, or outright covered in ice. The room is overly large and has a huge fire going in the side that doesn't seem to give out any heat. A lot of furs lie draped around the room \[ \]
21. This bedroom is made out of sandstone and mimics the dry heat of some kind of desert-like environment.  Across every wall you can see colourful murals, along with hieroglyphics. Magical torches line the walls, without giving out any heat. In the corner is an hourglass full of pure white sand that seems to be permanently running. Among the hieroglyphics is a message in thieves cant, it reads '*the bloods good for mummies at night*' \[ \]
22. This room is somewhat outside and features a warm mountain hot spring that is filled with unusually coloured water. A small welcome book explains that this is because of a blessing of a long forgotten god, and invites people to leave offerings in the water. In reality, the innkeeper uses dyes - and then steals offerings for profit. \[ \]
23. This gaudy bedroom is decorated in the style of a torture chamber. This room specializes in providing a ""hellish"" atmosphere overall, mostly for a richer and younger clientele. A few real weapons hang here, and elves can recognize they are made by drow, although everyone can recognize one is demonic. Removing the rug on the floor reveals a mostly finished summoning circle. \[ \]
24. The owner's vile {$pet$|$vermin$} has claimed this room, despite the owner's insistent, apologetic removal of such, the creature keeps returning and laying claim to your belongings as a sort of bed. Other than the pet, the room is passably clean and habitable, if small. The bed is undersized, has a hole in it, and is sagging, but the bedding has been changed recently, and the bedclothes washed, if mismatched. A pile of used equipment for various hobbies takes up one corner, and the small, hand-made, ratty cupboard beside the bed is filled with dust and an old copy of an obscure religious text. Of note, the walls have been papered in a mish-mash of old, official proclamations, each one bearing a date no younger than 20 years ago, but all bearing official seals, and are in good condition. There is a rodent hole in the base of the wall, that the pet seems intent on guarding, either to lay claim to, or hunt the inhabitants of, it isn't clear. \[ \]
25. Who would have thought that the words: ""quiet"", ""cozy"", and ""back to your roots"" meant a literal hole in the ground? The room is a small cell, literally underground. A tiny tin-stove no bigger than a small bucket keeps the cell warm, and the exhaust (as well as fresh air) is let in through a set of small pipes made from lead that snake up crookedly along the wall to (what you may hope is) the surface. The bed is simply a rolled up woven reed mat on a small wooden platform some few inches off the mortared flagstones. The walls of the cell too, are mortared stone, and (even to the eyes of a dwarf or stonemason) were once neat and meticulously detailed in their construction, and only now showing some small amount of wear from time and weather. The door to the cell is tightly fitted and round, and nearly no sound escapes through it. If there are any secrets hidden in this very clean and minimalist chamber it might take a very detailed investigation to find them; a hidden door or passage would be particularly noteworthy to find.  \[ \]
26. This chamber seems larger than it actually should be, considering its location inside this structure. It is opulently appointed, with nearly every object and surface featuring (some would say) an overdone level of detail and treatment. Papered in an large and elaborate pattern featuring many colors, the chamber features a carved and gilt covered chair-rail at waist height, as well as a continuous brass curtain rail at head height allowing the walls to be covered or exposed at will by a set of thick curtains and rich tapestries of expensive make. The furniture features elaborate feet, as well as a very large wardrobe fit for nobility. All in all, though, the room seems to contain just about too much \*stuff\*, despite its size; giving the impression that the decorators were more intent about conveying status, than utility.  \[ \]
27. The smooth stone floor of this chamber has been expertly carved with scenes of daily life, and (with inspection) appear to be a historical record of some notable local event. Smooth, polished teak and black walnut parquetries line the wall in geometric, puzzle-like patterns, showing off an extreme amount of skill in the carpentry, and making it seem that this chamber is inside of some sort of puzzle-box -- perhaps it really is, but the solution to a puzzle such as this would be very difficult. All the furniture is highest quality, and seems as precisely placed as the stone and wood-work.  \[ \]
28. The entire chamber is painted a rich, midnight blue, with a single polished brass lamp with a set of clever rotating covers pierced with small holes. When the lamp is lit, and the door closed the cover rotates smoothly, projecting the starry night sky upon the walls, in a seemingly soothing display. Careful study of the projected constellations will reveal precision and skill in the astrological placement of the holes. The furniture too, fits the color scheme of the chamber, wood upholstered in rich blue, as well as a woven rug of the same color.  \[ \]
29. There's blood and bubbles of saliva on the floor. The furniture has been either pushed into a corner or broken up and burned overnight on a couple of stolen cobblestones near the window. Discarded scales and broken bones devoid of marrow indicate the former occupants were Lizardfolk. \[ \]
30. Everything is half the size it should be, even the ceiling. It looks downright cozy for a Halfling or Gnome. The red velvet recliner, ottoman, fireplace, and couch really highlights the comfort Halflings expect even while traveling. \[ \]
31. The wall opposite the door is covered with numerous hunting trophies taxidermied and stuffed. It's unsettling to anyone that isn't a Ranger. The fur rugs and blankets are particularly warming on a cold night. \[ \]"
380,"Afternoon all,

In my ongoing post-apocalyptic campaign, the players are trying to leave the big city; I can't have any of that! The guards won't let anyone out of the gate, unless they can prove their hardiness.

Welcome to the test: There is a backpack among a pile of human bones 100 yards from the northern gate. In three rounds most PC's can run out, grab, and run back with, the backpack. Any group wanting to prove they can make it in the world must send one (and only one) of their members out to retrieve it. Nature, or at least the chaos that's been unleashed from it, does everything within it's power to stop this person. Each round the GM (myself) will roll on this chart to see what new challenge Nature has in store for the challenger. Here are 100 examples:

1. Localized Acid Rain - Forming from the thick woods around the trail, an aggressive purple cloud wills itself together and drenches its victim. (As the [Acid Storm]( spell, 3d8 damage per round)
2. Carnivorous, Large Squirrel - The size of a stout horse, this massive squirrel has a taste for meat and always gets his prey. (As a [Dire Wolf]( but with a fly speed of 40)
3. Earthen Maw - Forming without warning, a pit forms directly underneath the challenger. A DC 28 Reflex (Dexterity) check is required to avoid it and suffer 40 feet of fall damage to the tunnels below.
4. Drawn and Quartered, Nature's Way - With their branches slithering like vines, the surrounding trees limbs reach out at your arms, legs, and neck, attempting to pull you into their embrace. (As a [Trapjaw Swarm]( which only retreats if the challenger moves within the city walls)
5. Quicksand - Despite there being a solid, previously well-traveled trail, a 15-foot wide patch of [quicksand]( appears beneath the challenger. He risks suffocation, yes, but more importantly, the longer he stays beyond the gates, the more of Nature's wrath he'll be faced with.
6. ""Fire"" Ants, [**Coolguy123456789012**](
7. Vampiric Mosquitos, [**Coolguy123456789012**](
8. Giant Mantis, [**Coolguy123456789012**](
9. Poison Ivy, [**Coolguy123456789012**](
10. Lightning, [**Coolguy123456789012**](
11. ""Blades"" of Grass, [**Coolguy123456789012**](
12. Localized Gravity Reversal, [**Coolguy123456789012**](
13. ""That Wasn't There a Second Ago,""  [**Coolguy123456789012**]( You trip on a rock in your haste to get the backpack, high dex check or you're prone and have to waste an action getting up and attackers get advantage.
14. Beautiful Beasts, [**Coolguy123456789012**]( Butterflies swarm you, blinding you with their beautiful colors and giving enemies advantage to hit.
15. Corpse, [**Coolguy123456789012**]( E**w, you find the rotting corpse of a small child swarming with maggots who wandered out of the camp a couple nights ago. You now have to deliver the news to the grieving family before to guard will let you leave. You're thoroughly demoralized (some sort of intelligence check maybe?) and roll with disadvantage next turn.
16. Mirage, [**OGFinalDuck**]( essentially the hallucinatory terrain spell. Could be used to exhaust players by having them chase imaginary water in a drought, or to make them not notice that cliff.
17. Fog, [**OGFinalDuck**]( you can’t see while in this fog, and the DM rolls a d4 when it appears to determine what it’ll do to you:
18. No extra effects.
19. Cold damage each turn until exit and terrain is difficult.
20. Poison Damage each turn unless you hold your breath.
21. Each turn, take Acid damage and a random piece of gear gets a -1 to AC if it’s armour or to attack and damage rolls if it’s a weapon (and so on, it could affect thieves tools too).
22. [Hoser]( [**OGFinalDuck**](
23. Mutant Chicken Attack, [**Moon\_Dew**]( A flock of ill-tempered mutant chickens attacks the player.
24. Nature's Tears, [**No-Guard-8089**]( the grass beneath your feet suddenly grows slick with dew and becomes near frictionless, (effects mimic a Grease spell, Reflex save or fall prone). Effect is mitigated if the PC is barefoot.
25. Nature's Sweat, [**No-Guard-8089**]( Between the patches of grass are murky pools containing random liquids. if you pass through the space containing them, make an acrobatics/athletics check to attempt to avoid contact. if contact is made, roll 1d4 to determine contents:
26. dilute acid- if barefoot, take 1d6 damage. otherwise, this damage is done to your footwear.
27. dirty water- if barefoot, make save vs. disease (are there stats for ""trench foot""? there must be...)
28. clinging mud- footwear becomes stuck. make a strength check or remove footwear to escape
29. viscous slime- DC 15 reflex save or fall prone. save DC is reduced by 5 if you are barefoot
30. Nature's blood, [**No-Guard-8089**]( the field is dotted with tiny holes, each containing hungry vermin that nip at you if passing through their square. if you are wearing footwear, make a DC 10 reflex save: success results in taking 1d4 damage, on failure you take no damage but lose the footwear. if you are not wearing footwear, take d6 damage & gain the bleeding condition (no save)
31. Nature's Reward, [**No-Guard-8089**]( As you enter the field, you can sense the countless hungry eyes turning invisibly upon you, which condense into a palpable predatory aura. You must make a Will save just to proceed (fear effect), and must reroll that save to begin moving again if you have halted your progress. Additionally, if at any point you fall prone or are suffering from the bleeding condition, 1d6 swarms of vermin emerge from nearby burrows and begin converging on your location.
32. Domain of The Frozen Blade, [**SageofTheBlanketdPig**]( A 50ft radius dome of freezing cold flurries forms around the challenger, attempting to bind them in ice. The challenger must make a DC15 strength saving throw or have their movement speed reduced by half while within the dome.Additionally, as the challenger moves while inside the dome, they must make a dexterity(acrobatics) check to avoid swirling razor sharp snowflakes. On a failure, the challenger takes (1d6) slashing damage for every 5ft of movement within the dome.
33. Frozen Lake, [**SageofTheBlanketdPig**]( A thin layer of frost swiftly spreads out from the first footstep out onto the path. With an uncautious step, the ice cracks and reveals that beneath the rime is a freezing cold lake. The challenger must make a dexterity(acrobatics) check DC15 to carefully move across the fragile frost layer or plummet into the cold water beneath, taking 1d4 cold damage every round until they escape.
34. Golden Shower, [**SageofTheBlanketdPig**]( A black storm cloud overhead crackles with golden lightning. A pitter-patter sound accompanies a wave of heat as a rain of molten gold begins.  
   To rush ahead ensures at least a minor scalding as a failed DC30 dexterity save means taking taking 1d10 fire damage. Using some kind of cover might mitigate the risk. Depending on challenger size, a large rucksack or maybe a table can be used as cover against the storm.  
   However, this cover will take the damage in your stead. Who knows how long the cover will hold up?"

382,"I want some trials that would be given by a powerful individual. It doesnt just have to be a god a fey or warlock patron would work. The trials could also be for evil beings. Feel free to add a variation of the same trial as well.

1. Trial of Honor - PC is told that he needs to win a foot race to complete the trial. PC is giving numerous opportunities to cheat along the way. If taken then the PC fails regardless if the PC finishes first.

2. Trial of Strength - PC has to keep two stone pillars from toppling over. The DC gets increasingly harder. The PC can only complete the trial when they ask their party mates for help.

3. Trial of Worthiness - PC has to climb a steep mountain in a race to the top, an npc and a competitor need help climbing the mountain. PC can only win if they decide to help the other 2 individuals 

4. Trial of Blood (Evil)- PC is told to kill and elderly person who is extremely evil. When they find the person its a child in an orphanage.

5. Trial of Devotion (Evil) - PC is told that he needs to kill the thing that they love most.

6. Trial of Taxation. The devil in question is just really fucking tired and will give you a way over leveled item for doing it, no funny business. Obviously the players won't trust that.

7. Trial of Hypocratic Sacrifice - those dedicated to the Saint of Healing must recreate her original trial and treat at a plague ravaged ward. They will slowly get sicker and weaker with heavier afflictions and maladies but they must trudge on.

8. Trial of Kumite - Before the PC is a single 60 foot by 60 foot raised platform. Surrounding the ring is number of powerful warriors. The PC must be the last one standing in the ring after a number of 1-v-1 fights. For better party interaction, the opponents will attempt to tip the odds in their favour so the other players must both stop this and attempt to aid the attempter as subtly as they can.

9. Trial of Valor - The party is transported back in time to a famous onesided battle... On the losing side. No matter how clever or skilled they are, even if they manage to do major damage to the opposing army, there is no way they are snatching victory. They are supposed to fight valiantly, without surrender or retreat until they die to the last. They will be ressurected once the trial ends. "
383,"The idea is that if a character randomly runs into a commoner/peasant/villager NPC(s) in a settlement or while traveling along the countryside or wherever, that NPC might have some sort of motivation or want/need that they may talk about or request of the players (assuming they're relatively friendly and not trying to kill the PCs). I just wanted something to add some flavor to random NPC encounters other than always having shopping, story-related or combat interactions, these could potentially be a source of short side quests that come along, an opportunity to sell/barter/negotiate, or even just silly encounters that maybe don't go anywhere. These would be paired with the NPCs general demeanor/reaction towards the player(s), so some might go in different directions depending on how positively/negatively an NPC views the player(s).

&#x200B;

# d100 Random NPC Interactions, Motivations, Wants, or Needs

&#x200B;

1. Lost and needs directions to the nearest settlement (or a different settlement if already in one).
2. Recently ran into a large sum of gold and looking to blow it all at the nearest tavern (may or may not invite players along depending on reactions).
3. Traveling on pilgrimage to a holy site and looks to convert any who listen to them for too long.
4. On their way to a pay off a debt with a local lord, but something mundane is impeding their travel (broken wheel, lame horse/mule, muddy road, etc)
5. They've never been outside their home village before and they're gawking at everything they're seeing around them, may request to tag along with the players if they're especially far from any settlements.
6. They're low or empty on food and provisions and just need something to eat, they look ragged and malnourished.
7. They've been sent on a job to deliver some supplies to a merchant at a local settlement, but their horse is barely able to move the cart and is likely to exhaust itself.
8. They ask if you'd be interested in playing them at a well-known game (dice, knucklebones, draughts, drinking, etc). May or may not have bets made on the result, depending on demeanor.
9. They have a rather embarrassing wardrobe malfunction that they haven't noticed yet, but stop to ask for a smoke.
10. They're reading some sort of official edict or bit of news from a courier and they can't believe the audacity of it, they just have to take your time up by complaining to somebody about it. No amount of polite conversation enders will suffice until they've wasted hours of the player's time.
11. They've lost a pet of some kind in the area and they're quite frantic about getting them back, as if they had lost a child.
12. They seem rather confused about everything and can't quite place what they're doing there or why they're even talking to the players. Nothing they say seems to make any particular sense. Causes may range from being elderly, drugged, exhausted, just plain mentally unbalanced, or some other reason.
13. They've got an item that they're trying to get rid of and the player(s) seem like the sort of folk that may want to trade them for it. Most likely it's a relatively mundane item , but potentially could be something of higher value.
14. They're feuding with a significant other and the argument is getting quite loud. The argument doesn't get particularly physical or violent, just many personal details are aired in public to everyone within earshot.
15. They're taking a break from some sort of job they're performing and looking for any excuse they can to just not work right now and the player(s) seem interesting enough to talk to.
16. They've got a piece of clothing or gear that's in some state of disrepair and keeping them from moving on, but they don't have anything to repair it with.
17. They seem to be taking notes on some feature of the area around them, an object, an animal or monster, or even the people or players themselves. They're apparently writing these for a book or journal of some kind and they will act distracted regarding anything the players talk to them about.
18. They know of a checkpoint that will be encountered coming into a local settlement. They seem particularly concerned about something they have with them and need help getting it through the checkpoint. Depending on the NPC, it may or may not be illegal contraband or just an item that would likely get stolen by the guards at the checkpoint.
19. They're on their way back home after a particularly difficult journey, they're worn out and exhausted and not in a good mood to talk with anybody.
20. They're happy to tag along with the players or have extra room on a cart/wagon for them to hitch a ride to the nearest settlement or farmstead and aren't looking for anything in return apart from some good conversation.
21. They're having some sort of disagreement with a traveling companion regarding a basic fact that neither can agree on. Neither seems particularly intelligent enough to understand the subject, but both claim to be experts on the thing.
22. They see something that the player(s) are carrying with them and are immediately interested in buying the thing. They're some sort of collector or connoisseur or just a person in desperate need of the thing. Depending on reactions/skill-use, might be persuaded to pay above regular price for it.
23. They've been carrying a bundle of small items on their back, but a hole in their sack has been causing some of the things to slowly fall out behind them. They're unaware of what's happening when they meet the player(s).
24. They're looking for some sort of unique feature in the area, it could be a local attraction, a holy site, something potentially supernatural or unexplained, or just a landmark they were supposed to be meeting somebody at.
25. They're trying particularly hard to ingratiate themselves with the player(s). It's obvious that they want something from them (money, food, items, help), but won't just come right out and say it.
26. They've recently injured themselves. It's not particularly life-threatening, but it's definitely hampering their ability to travel and/or get things done.
27. They've been sent somewhere far off to buy something and are looking for any potential alternative they can to save themselves the trip. It's not really urgent, they just don't really want to travel that far for it.
28. They've been called upon a by a local lord into service with a militia or army or into some kind of group and they're having second thoughts about joining up. They're rather indecisive and they could easily be persuaded either way with a good enough argument.
29. They're asking very direct questions about a specific person or thing in the area, trying to get any details they can about where a person or thing is and who was the last person they/it were seen with. Depending on reactions, they may be aggressive in their questioning or just leave it at whatever the players answer with before moving on. They'll do their best to avoid giving away why they're looking for the person or thing.
30. They're an apprentice of some kind who was given a job to do by their master, but seemed to have mucked the whole thing up and they're at a loss for what they should do next.
31. They're fed up with a local authority or official in the area and seem to be looking for anyone they can find in the area who agrees with them to try to do something about it.
32. They've caught something quite small and unusual that they're not sure about, they'd like some help on how to handle it as they're not sure if they should just let it go or if it's too dangerous/valuable to be set free.
33. They need a courier to deliver an important message to somebody in a settlement far away, but they require the utmost secrecy regarding the message. If ever opened, the message itself that is getting delivered doesn't seem to make any sense and may be in some sort of coded language.
34. They feel like someone or something has been following them. Stalking them. Can the PCs check it out?
35. The NPC is certain that they’ve seen you before, but can’t remember where. Was it on a wanted poster? Was it in the Tavern? Was it on the ship coming over from their homeland? They just can’t put their finger on it…
36. They lost an item. They had it on them yesterday, and they thought they had it with them when they started out this morning, but it’s missing now. Have you seen it?
37. They’re writing a travelogue about this area would like to ask you some questions about what you’ve seen as far as flora and fauna, locals, the surrounding terrain and countryside.
38. They’re desperate for coin and willing to part with what they say is a valuable family heirloom.
39. They just need to travel with someone because “safely in numbers” and they don’t feel safe traveling alone, but you look like you can offer some measure of protection.
40. They ask which way is south. They’re supposed to meet someone around here and their not sure if they need to go further, or if they’ve gone too far already.
41. The NPC approaches the party with a scowl on their face. They accuse one of the PCs of sleeping with their partner. There's a rampant adulterer afoot who looks quite similar to the PC.
42. A duel is about to unfold and one of the participants is a child. (The child is either helpless or a skilled assassin; DMs choice.)
43. It's clear that they're following you and trying to listen in on anything you're saying, either by hiding in bushes or trying to act nonchalant, but they don't seem to be very good at hiding themselves. They will run away if confronted and they'll just say that ""somebody"" paid them a gold coin to do it, but can't give any other details, no matter how much they're questioned.
44. They have some sort of bird on their shoulder that talks quietly in their ear, almost as if it is the bird itself that is telling the person what to say. The person asks the player(s) about what they know of any potential uprisings from ""the Rat Guild"" or the ""Council of Cats"". They speak in hushed tones and keep looking at the ground all around them to make sure there are no animals around.
45. No matter the difference in age between NPC and the players, they look at the player(s) as if they were new to adventuring and tries to give them professional advice and starts trying to impress them with stories of their own adventures before they settled down.
46. They notice something out of place or in need of repair that the player(s) are carrying and offer to repair it or know someone who could repair it for a small fee (10% discount on whatever the normal cost would be).
47. They're on the lookout for a certain person and asking anybody they come across if they've seen them. That person was their former business partner who cheated them out of a good deal of money and/or supplies. They will get violent if and when they find the person.
48. They say that they're just out for a walk, which suggests they're home is nearby. If the group is not in a city and they have a favorable reaction or if the players are particularly friendly, they may offer them a drink if they come back to their place. They provide drinks and some conversation, this isn't a trap.
49. They're pulling a child by the hand with them, the child seems especially distraught and may also be actively crying. The adult won't say anything to the player(s), but will growl at the child and tell them to ""Shut yer' damn hole!"" and other such things. If confronted, they'll tell the players to ""Mind yer' own damn business!"" It's a parent, just bringing their child with them back home from some mischief.
50. They're an older NPC, simply resting by the side, wiping their brow (or shivering in furs if it's cold out). They look exhausted and worn out. A pile of split logs lays behind them, but they hardly seem in any condition to gather it up themselves, not at the moment at least.
51. They're looking for a particular animal or monster to watch. They're not hunting it to catch or kill, they just like watching that kind of animal/monster and take notes on all the different ones they've seen before. Potentially may have some useful notes on lore or behavior or physical differences among creatures of that species. They're a hobbyist who just likes seeing the thing out in the wild.
52. They seem to be traveling with something particularly disgusting, not dangerous or very valuable, just a pile of something gross and unpleasant. They won't comment on the thing and will try to just change the subject if it's brought up. They will get offended if pressed on it and just try to leave without any explanation.
53. They're carrying a map and shovel with them that they say they bought some ways back from a treasure hunter. They'll be defensive and guarded if they suspect the player(s) are trying to get their treasure. If the player(s) are persuasive  or agree not to take any of the treasure, they'll continue the search with them. The spot marked 'X' is close by. On low odds (roll of 1), they'll actually find something quite valuable. Otherwise they'll either dig an empty hole and find nothing or will find something of questionable value, possibly it's just junk that was freshly buried. If it's the latter, the NPC will start running in the direction they said they bought the map from.
54. They appear to be playing a sport of some sort involving a ball and a stick or mallet. The rules aren't immediately apparent. On a negative reaction, they'll blame you for any bad shots that are made, on a good reaction they'll ask about playing through or may even ask the player(s) to join in. Bets may or may not be made on the results.
55. They're looking for love in all the wrong places and have become attracted to somebody or some thing that will cause a lot of problems for them. They're truly blinded by love.
56. They're not very proficient in the local language, and looking for somebody who can help them get through a transaction.
57. They're fascinated by new stories and faraway places, and the PCs' appearance suggests they have good stories to tell.
58. They're being harassed (sexually or otherwise) by a third party and hope that hanging around imposing people will dissuade the harasser.
59. They're pursuing a religious duty to do a good deed (daily, as penance for a sin, or whatever) and want to know if they can help the PCs with anything.
60. They've been robbed and are searching for anybody who has seen anything. There may be an edge of suspicion that the PCs might be the thieves.
61. There's a spot right above the small of their back that desperately needs itching, and they can't reach it.
62. They need to exchange large or foreign coins, or non-coin treasure, for more readily usable coins.
63. They're hamhandedly attempting some task that one of the PCs is expert at; if the PC is empathic at all, they will be very tempted to offer help.
64. They've cooked too much food and are looking for somebody to help eat it.
65. They appear to be a professional in their field and put on the airs of somebody who knows alot about what they do, but if the players engage in any sort of in-depth conversation with them, they'll likely discover that this person has no idea what they're actually talking about. If confronted about it, they'll admit that they don't actually know anything about it, they're just trying to make ends meet and plead with the player(s) to not expose them.
66. A pair of NPCs are taking turns making shots at a target, neither seems to be particularly good at shooting, but they brag and boast no matter how bad their shots are. Depending on their reactions to the player(s), they may challenge the player(s) to a round of target shooting. Potentially they're running a con.
67. No matter what time of day it is, they are staggering down the path towards you, obviously drunk and shouting ridiculous things at anybody they see or who passes by. If the player(s) don't watch their step around the NPC(s), one of the drunks will almost trip and fall into them, then begin vomiting all over the player(s) shoes.
68. They're standing around next to what looks like a small wreath of flowers, it almost looks like a memorial of some sort to mark a spot where something must have happened. They're sweeping the space with a broom and are apparently talking to themselves. They pay no mind to the player(s) unless talked to, even then, it will take them a minute to hear the player.
69. They are a pitiful sight with their tin cup in hand. Shambling down the road on one leg and a crutch, one of their eyes covered with a bandage and their hair stringy and unwashed. The smell that emanates from them is horrible and makes you want to gag. They stop in front of you, not saying anything, just holding out the cup, shaking it ever so slightly.
70. They're standing as still as a rock, in a resting or active position, just looking forward at nothing in particular. They don't seem to be registering any sights or sounds. However, if they're touched in any way, they will snap out of whatever it was that had frozen them and will continue on as if nothing had happened. There's no way to really tell how long they had been like that.
71. They have a big smile on their lips, and a dribble of spit coming from the side of their mouth. Trying to talk to them seems an effort in futility, as they only smile back and nod their head, but there doesn't seem to be any sense of understanding from them.
72. Two NPCs are arguing about what is in the third verse of a popular song. They want the PCs to resolve the argument for them.
73. A middle-aged person seizes on the notion that one of the PCs would make a good marriage partner for their daughter. It turns out that they're trying to outrun their daughter's own hopes for a marriage that they consider unsuitable.
74. Some NPCs wish to hold a religious ceremony which, by ancient custom, requires at least one more participant.
75. A landowner is frustrated with crop failures and is looking for a better place to move to. They want information about soil, rainfall, insects, and so forth in the places that the PCs have traveled through.
76. A tavern keeper has been dealing with a group of aggressive rowdies who have been monopolizing their establishment and driving other customers away. They offer free refreshments if the PCs can drive off the rowdies.
77. A small group is raising a barn or some other building and is short of muscle to accomplish it. They promise a delicious feast afterward.
78. A person's son is being wooed by an allegedly heroic veteran of the wars. The man is suspicious and wants someone to prove or disprove her claims, especially in a way that convinces the son.
79. They have been called upon to perform a duty by a person in authority, and are honor-bound to carrying it out, however, they don't seem to be in any physical condition to actually carry out the duty itself.
80. They have become disillusioned with a local religious leader and are preaching to anyone that will listen that that religion is full of lies and blasphemies, that the truly chosen people need to rise up against the false believers.
81. They seem to be maintaining this local area, protecting it from harm in whatever small ways they can, either cleaning up or repairing or just generally keeping things in good order around. They may see any attempt to camp out in the area as a defilement unless precautions or they are appeased in some way.
82. They were part of a refugee group that got separated and they're desperately searching for their spouse and children. They're frantically asking if anybody has seen them and they seem on the verge of tears.
83. They're walking towards you barely clothed, a desperate look in their face. Apparently bandits have stolen everything from them, including the clothes off their back. They point off in the direction they came from and where, presumably, the bandits might still be found if you hurried.
84. The NPC stops their wagon near the party and starts yelling: ""The baby's coming!"" over and over. There is a woman who is pregnant and the baby is about to come out.
85. The NPC stops their wagon near the party and starts yelling: ""The baby's coming!"" over and over. There is a cow in the back of the wagon who is pregnant and the calf is about to come out.
86. A flock of birds takes flight from a nearby bush shortly followed by an arrow that embeds itself in the ground near a party member. The archer can be seen standing a few dozen feet behind the bush in the shadows under a tree. A) If the party talks to the archer, they find a pre-teen child who was trying to shoot the birds and missed. The father shows up shortly and explains this is the child's first hunting trip. B) If the party kills the archer, the archer's father will show up and explain through his tears that this was the child's first hunting trip and the child was inexperienced with a bow. The grief stricken father will tell the locals how the party committed manslaughter on his child and all interactions in the local area will have a negative response.
87. There's a wedding ceremony going on, how big or small depends on how many NPCs are there. The man looks happy at everything happening, but the bride seems less than enthused or is possibly even crying about the whole thing. Chances are this was an arranged marriage.
88. They stop the party from moving on here and insist that this spot of land here is their property and they won't be having trespassers. They say that the party will need to go around if they want to get wherever they're going, which based on what they're saying is ""their land"" will likely cost the party travel time.
89. An older person is pulling along a young child by a chain that is attached around their neck. The child isn't crying, but they're certainly not enjoying the treatment, yet they don't make any eye contact with the party or make any plea for help.
90. They're dressed quite provocatively and, regardless  of gender, they ask if you'd, ""like to have a go at it? If you got the coin, I got the time."" and give you a knowing glance.
91. They're part of an odd couple, both from two different races, but definitely in an intimate relationship. There's another individual or group nearby who has a problem with this and is insulting them, possibly even getting physical with at least one of the pair, finding the relationship to be disgusting. It might not already be violent, but it's about to get that way.
92. You hear moans, cries, and gasps coming from behind some cover, either behind some bushes or behind a window or some other location just outside of view. It sounds as though somebody is getting their insides torn out. Investigating the scene reveals that it is actually a couple getting intimate. They're incredibly surprised at being walked in on.
93. They're off on the side of the road, standing over a big cooking pot, stirring up a meal. They ask if you'd want to join them for a meal. Nothing bad happens, it's just a meal, lighten up.
94. They're part of a group standing around, they're singing or chanting some sort of song. As you stop to listen, you realize you can't understand any of the words, though they're oddly familiar, but just barely outside of your comprehension. As you listen longer, you find yourself getting mesmerized by the song.
95. They're trying to speak to you in an incomprehensible language, they're gesturing wildly at something ""over there"", but beyond that you have no idea what they're trying to tell you about. They seem quite insistent.
96. They're apparently passed out drunk, lying on the floor with an empty bottle still clutched in their hand. They don't appear to be in any immediate danger or anything and likely they'll wake up in a few hours, but close by sits a small bag, filled with gold coins, it looks like quite a bit of money. Nobody else seems to be around that would witness anything happening.
97. They are pacing around, looking up at the sky, they seem to be quite impatient about something, they're muttering something about, ""He was supposed to have been here by now, what's keeping him?"". If asked about who they're waiting for, they simply reply, ""Well I'm waiting for HIM obviously, who else would I be waiting for?"", but won't provide any elaboration as to who ""HIM"" is. If the players wait around with the character, nobody will show up, no matter how long they wait for, though at some point, after a few hours, the person(s) who were waiting will mysteriously have disappeared.
98. They're sitting off the beaten path, having a picnic of sorts, however, they don't speak any language you can recognize. They will only look at you coldly if you attempt to speak with them. If there is more than one in the group, they will say some things to each other while looking at you, but won't engage in any dialogue with you, though you suspect they can understand everything you're saying.
99. They're engaged in singing a song and possibly even playing some instruments. It's actually a good song, though you don't quite recognize it. If you stay to pass the time, they'll play a number of different tunes, some may even drop some historical lore.
100. They have a fantastic business opportunity that they'd love to talk with you about, if you just have a few moments to spare! This is like nothing else you've ever heard of and you'll be kicking yourself if you let an opportunity like this pass you by! This is what you would call an upward mobility business arrangement, for a small fee every month, you can recruit others into your small business, who then pay you a recruitment fee every month, everybody wins!"

Roll a d4 with the following table. 4 = hand-written message; 3 = sign language; 2 = Morse code; 1 = This is an automatic screw loose, why? Because the severed hand tries so hard to deliver the message very quickly that it isn't able to communicate properly.

[Coming from the post in]( [r/dnd]( about the DM who accidentally put Edward from Twilight into his game as the BBEG, but who's players are now wanting to help him: how can a secret BBEG trick the heroes into doing evil?

edit: is this the correct way to attempt to get a list finished, to repost it?

1. Claim the shopkeeper used trickery to steal your family heirloom inheritance, ask the players to retrieve it.
2. Endgame: ""The orphanage is actually a demon cult under a permanent mass illusion""
3. Dopplegangers murdering innocents whilst disguised as the innocent old widow lady [
4. He must sell a lie to the general public 'for their own good' as they would panic if they knew the truth and the party's bard will be instrumental in keeping the peace. (The lie isn't actually for the good of the public. Just look at whatever newspaper you disagree with for examples)
5. An actual good NPC comes with urgent news of terrible evil incoming, but the BBEG convinces them that there is another greater issue for them to face and that he has the good NPCs quest covered, obviously allowing the evil thing to happen.
6. They’re hired to escort a group of refugees to safety, but they’re actually escorting them into slavery. /nurse\_camper](
7. The party is hired to bring a crate of valuable medicine to a faraway city facing a debilitating wasting disease. You are warned that you will face opposition on your way, and may have to smuggle it in, and that it would be confiscated if found. Your party is approached with urgency and paid handsomely. However it's not medicine, it's all addictive narcotics. /thezintis](
8. The party comes across an armed caravan being attacked by paladins and knights. They are in the process of being defeated, and the last few defenders are guarding a young child. The party intervenes and saves the child, and on the deathbed of the last defender, are asked to bring them to the Temple of Happy Times. The party may face more resistance along the way, with more paladins and champions claiming that the child is evil and will destroy us all. They get the child to the temple, are rewarded, and all seems well. Until hell breaks loose because they were the last piece of some doomsday puzzle the Temple was trying to release. /thezintis](
9. The party is contracted by a local lord to clear the forest of dire wolves. These wolves seem largely disinterested in the human settlements, but the lord is worried about their farms. As you venture into the forest you notice that there are quite a few of these off vermin-like creatures around, some kind of ugly rat (dire lemming?) with very powerful mandibles, but your party has no real problems, stepping on them after one of you receives a nasty bite. As you track the wolves you notice that they very often go after these little creatures, and you decide to use them to lure them out as a trap. You manage to slay somewhere over 100 wolves in your quest, and return to the lord with their pelts for your prize. He invites you to stay a week or two for a holiday upcoming, also to act as guards in the meantime. As you wait a few days, you notice some of those rat pests around town, fighting with cats, stealing a vendor's apple, and such. At some point you notice one in the lord's mansion, even in your own chamber. As the holiday approaches, you find more and more of these things around, to the point where there are isolated infestations of them in the poorer side of town, and you are hired to clear them out. Further investigation shows that the forest is now overrun. They are everywhere, like locusts, and consuming everything. But unlike locusts they are faster, smarter, and will eat/attack anything. Your party now has to somehow deal with this ecological disaster and try to defend the town from the unending swarms of hungry lemmings. /thezintis](
10. Give free, scented, and warm blankets to the poor and needy on the opposing side that they can not publicly support. (Unsaid: these are plague blankets. They were wrapped on diseased bodies and are unclean but, perfumed to hide it with) /th3r3493r](
11. Deliver looted medical supplies to a humanitarian medical group which has been treating both sides and merely requesting safe haven and a bit of support. (Unsaid: the medical supplies is poisoned, expired, and of poor construction. Using the medical supplies will kill more than save but, it will have the seal of the opposing side on the bad supplies will lead for a good propaganda piece.) /th3r3493r](
12. Kill a settlement of mutants who settled in an abandoned mine that reportedly killed the miners and engineers that worked there. (Unsaid: the mutants are the miners and engineers that were experimented on and left down there to die. This was not a problem until one mutant escaped and managed to tell a corrupt guard of a local town in broken common the truth before the guard attacked and killed it.) /th3r3493r](
13. A wealthy merchant and their spouse have recently made enemies within the city and need their child to be safely escorted to their grandmother's house in a difficult to reach location in a forest/on a mountain. Along the way, the party encounters many challenges (monsters/terrain) but finally arrives and finds a very kind old woman who lives in a quaint house. Although all seems fine, a character who succeeds on a DC 20 Perception check notices the faint smell of rotting flesh, animal excrement, and swamp water. Long ago, the young merchant had made an unfortunate deal with a hag, great wealth in exchange for a single piece of their ""valuable treasure"" nknown at the time to be the merchant's future child). If the party fails to notice and returns, they find the couple distraught, beyond consolation but are paid. If the party defeats the hag and tries to return the child to the couple, they find the couple gruesomely flayed in the child's room and all objects of monetary/emotional value gone from the house. /slight\_tea](
14. Hire the party to seal a portal to hell/the abyss/some demonic plane. Left unsaid: The greatest defender of good in the realm just went in to rescue somebody and they need that portal to get back out again. /rjcade](
15. They're hired to loot a dungeon, they get supplied and 30% of treasure found but the dungeon guardian they defeat is the real prize and will be upgraded and sold to the highest bidding military power. /bivitorofzork](
16. A young adventurer of some local fame asks the party for assistance. His sister was sacrificed to the church who are secretly devil worshipers. They have a demon sealed inside the cathedral basement. -- it turns out that the church is actually imprisoning the demon. They are studying ways to keep this one from coming back so damn often. The adventurer is the demon's brother, who saved a few villages so he can gain renown and use it to ask for help to free his brother and destroy many more villages in the long run. /mcdeathcore](
17. Blue lanterns are scattered around the township. Going within 1 foot of one makes a PC roll a con check. The townspeople are out with signs protesting these lanterns. They claim they make them sick. Convince the local lord to replace the traditional lighting. -- turns out they started using these lamps because they keep the battlefield the township was built on at rest. Once they are mostly turned off, the dead start to rise from the ground. Also the con check doesn't do anything at all. All the lamps do is make the PC's feel like something is wrong. hue hue hue mwa ha hahahaha. /mcdeathcore](
18. PC's finally destroy the dungeon core that was creating monsters. -- turns out the dungeon core wasn't spawning them, It only kept them inside the dungeon. /mcdeathcore](
19. Scar the BOSS bear. It is finally hibernating and adventurers are around. What an opportunity for the villages, they had lost several cows over the years. -- Turns out scar was keeping his territory clean of other more annoying pests. aka an orc encampment eager for a new raiding target. /mcdeathcore](
20. You encounter a righteous metallic dragon, defender of the appropriate principles of it's type! Overcome by the emotion of such a meeting you endeavour to assist it without thinking too deeply about what it asks. (It turns out that it was actually a coloured dragon covered in glitter, or otherwise disguised and lying to you. Maybe a blue dragon pretending to be cobalt, or a yellow dragon pretending to be gold?) /lucidfir](
21. If one of your players is the type to want an in game romance, or perhaps even a legendary macguffin, have them work hard to acquire said interest. The romantic interest is low key evil, the legend surrounding the macguffin was created by the BBEG and it is actually cursed. Once this is set up and the player trusts the NPC/Item more than their co-players, go full secret Hitler and start dropping hints through 'skill checks' and private notes that one of the other players is actually working for the BBEG. Sow the seeds of suspicion! /lucidfir](
22. The group assists a rebel group fighting against the local king/government. They are asked to help the group secure the local water supply, to take this power from the authorities. But as the group helps them secure the well/spring etc., the rebels poison it, causing the death and suffering of the civilian population. As in the rebels opinion, everyone not fighting with them is fighting against them. /psquall](
23. The owner of an orphanage asks the group to lead the search for a lost child, as many citizen are enraged and distraught, in fear their own child could disappear. The search takes some times, but leads to a man that tried to sell the child. But it turns out he was just hired by the owner of the orphanage to hide the child. Meanwhile the orphanage is abandon, local residents claiming the owner wanted to bring the other children to a 'saver place'. /psquall](
24. The emperor rules the lands with an iron fist, the executed lining the 8 golden pathways to the wellspring of mana upon which the kingdom is founded, whilst the criminals who are executed are from the hungry poor. A charming robin hood type makes your acquaintance and convinces the party that according to ancient lore the land used to be fertile and a great bastion of civilisation in which all could prosper, and that the emperor uses the mana to achieve immortality. Whilst the hooded Ronin distracts with an uprising in the North, your task is to simply remove the bodies of the dying, and the corpses of the deceased, from the crosses lining the eightfold path. You achieve this. The wellspring is temporarily unrestrained. The gate is opened, for but a moment. You see the horrors that were kept at bay and the havoc that even a minute of their escape could unleash. The plucky Machiavellian spreads rumours that the emperor risked opening the portal to create fear, a false flag attack to ensure support for the war. A DC10 knowledge arcane or history or world or just about anything would have allowed you to know that the wellspring restraint was necessary, but the ""resistance"" leader trusted that you, as well meaning outsiders, would be easily led to do his bidding. A moment's humility to drop the saviour complex and treat the locals like humans would have informed you of such. /lucidfir](
25. ""Corrupted"" druids are fighting the famous philanthropist seeking to reforest the barren wastes. He is actually lying, he wants to profit from future logging, and the desert is a critical part of the local environment. /lucidfir](
26. Knowing of your pure heart, the BBEG arranges for you to rescue Grogu (or a similarly excessively cute innocent). As you respond to its cries to feed it slowly becomes clear that it requires more and more extreme food sources, where will the party stop?
27. You were sent to find record books, heirlooms, and art pieces. These items can be used by a disgraced noble to assert his claim to the throne but will cause a civil war.
28. You were sent to find agricultural artifacts. These items were given to malicious druids using plants to assault civilization.
29. You were sent to verify the existence of a gold vein for a mining company. It turns out the company works for a dragon wishing to grow its hoard.
30. You were sent to find weather-controlling artifacts. These items were given to revolutionaries that planned to attack a city with many new flammable buildings.
31. You were asked to transport rare exotic animals secretly to protect them from poachers. It turns out these animals inflict lycanthropy upon people that consume them.
32. You were sent to assist someone in reforming uncivilized people. It turns out that they plan to use these people to grow their own empire.
33. You were sent to clear a gang hideout. Later, a rival gang occupies this same hideout.
34. Guard some wizards while they finish casting Teleportation Circle in an isolated area in a walled city, the circle is used to bring in massive amounts of counterfeit gold coins that crater the local economy. /TheSpiderPlant](
35. A small town asks the adventurers to recover a gem stolen by a local thieves guild, the town turns out to actually be a cult and the gem is actually the prison of an ancient god that the cult is now trying to release to kill everyone. /that-armored-boi](
36. The adventurers find a prince on the side of the road that is lost and asks for help in getting home, turns out the prince is a key part of a prophecy that will plunge the kingdom into 1000 years of darkness and torment and the king was trying to save both the kingdom and his son by casting away the prince. /that-armored-boi](
37. You are asked by a farmer on the edge of arable land to wipe out the monster packs harming his flock. Those packs kept away more monstrous elements, causing a famine as even the inner farms are now threatened. /stamau123](
38. A lay-priests tells you of a lost artifact of his religion, claiming it to be from the time of its founding and a symbol for their people. It is actually a source of a long-dead early heresy and a symbol of division. It being uncovered may be enough to reignite a bloody schism. /stamau123](
39. Rescue a local noble's daughter from the clutches of an orc Warlord. The lady was given to the orcs as part of an arranged marriage marking peace between the Orcs and the human settlement. This action will cause outright war to break out between the two. /MutatedMutton](
40. Recover lost seeds in a wizard's tower to help the barren farmlands prevent famine. The seeds eventually grow into plant monsters that threaten to consume the surrounding lands. /MutatedMutton](
41. Help a convoy transport medical supplies into a wartorn village. Said aid is also a cover to help the convoy smuggle dangerous magical weapons into the country. /MutatedMutton](
42. Kill a bandit leader in the slums of a city. This leader is actually the head of a revolutionary group, whose murder makes him a martyr and galvanized the revolutionary sympathizers in the city into full civil war. /MutatedMutton](
43. You’re sent to assassinate a maniacal, but emotional and incompetent dictator bent on enslaving and/or laying waste to the “undesirable” population of the region. His successor is much more logical and level-headed, and he is able to carry out his own plans of genocide much more effectively. /comradejiang](
44. You are hired to distribute a vaccine/antidote/cure for a virus/disease that has been ravaging a duchy/kingdom. However, the disease as well as the cure have been concocted by the health minister/advisor to the duke/king and turns the people into bloodthirsty maniacs. (The advisor could've been paid or blackmailed by an enemy of the duke/king) /Weeeth](
45. Find old letters of a long dead hero of the people who saved the country and distribute it to the scholars who are against the kingdom but, will claim they are impartial. The letters are encrypted and will be ""decrypted"" to show how much of a ""terrible"" person was. In reality. /Th3R3493r](
46. Deliver a secret weapon that will turn the tides of a bloody war to a chaotic good rebellion leader against a tyrant. The secret weapon is a magical steroid that will kill the user in a matter of five months but, boost their abilities to inhuman levels with heightened but, controllable aggression. /Th3R3493r](
47. Deliver a cart of fine cloth blankets to a charitynion that champions workers' rights before winter sets. The fine cloth is tainted with terrible illnesses which will kill a bunch of workers and their families and turn people against the charitynion. /Th3R3493r](
48. Deliver dull yellow-green rocks to an artificer who is trying to make a new source of power from these strange rocks. The rocks are uranium-rich ore and nuclear fission will be made for better or worse. /Th3R3493r](
49. Destroy a circle of druids who have been seen killing merchants who travel directly through the center of the forest for the last three decades. The center of the forest is a place where a weak subspecies of ettercap lays eggs inside of living people which turns them into disoriented husks that seek out cities. An outbreak of these weak opportunistic ettercaps will slowly kill and scar many people. /Th3R3493r](
50. The group is paid to bury four stones in specific spots around the capital of the kingdom, they read as slightly magical but the person hiring them just says that the queen is superstitious and these stones will form a protective barrier and ease her mind. ""Coincidentally"" the comet that passes by every decade and can be seen in the night sky currently suddenly seems to be getting brighter as its progress along its path has stopped. The four points have created a target for the comet, centering it directly on the castle. /ksgt69](
51. Bandits have been attacking wealthy merchants and stealing their wares. Stop them. Except that this is an undercover scheme from the Baron to stop weapons shipments to rebels in his lands. /PM\_ME\_BEEF\_CURTAINS](
52. The blacksmith's daughter has been kidnapped by goblins. Rescue her from the ancient temple. Except that the BBEG has been searching for this temple for years as it holds great power. The goblins found it, and he refused to pay them, hence the kidnap. /PM\_ME\_BEEF\_CURTAINS](
53. A troll has moved into the mine, remove it. Except that the miners had discovered his scheme. Now they are dead, he wants to resume critical mining operations. /PM\_ME\_BEEF\_CURTAINS](
54. The group is hired to secure a set of magical stone tablets from an ancient forgotten temple. The magical tablets laying in the temple were the only thing sealing the portal to a plane of unbelievable evil. /ANeonDragon](
55. BBEG knows the party is out to get him, or at least is becoming very good at disrupting his/her operations. BBEG uses convincing agents naware accomplices themselves) to hire the party, using them to eliminate competition, fulfill promises, and further his goals while at the same time keeping them off their own scent. /originalohpeh](
56. Party hired by a tired King/lord/etc to help eliminate dangerous bandit/raider threat led by a cunning enemy. The party sees the burned villages and rotting corpses, proof of atrocity. In truth, the bandits are freedom fighters, the burned villages and massacred people results of false flag attacks and cleansing of undesirables by the King. /originalohpeh](
57. BBEG has succeeded in their goal, committing horrible acts in an ""ends justify the means"" mentality. They are intelligent and make logical, though brutal points. Goals completed, they no longer feel atrocity is necessary, focusing instead on ethically consolidating gains. However, they realize enemies have been made. They wish to hire the party for protection/enforcement, pardoning past ""disagreements"", arguing that if they fall, the cycle of violence will begin anew and likely much worse for all involved. /originalohpeh](
58. BBEG is profiting off of war and unrest. Party finds themselves taking part on one side or the other. The BBEG controls the narrative reaching people's of both sides, each convinced theirs is in the right while trying to explain away accusations of anything otherwise. Each action the party takes is spun up as heroic or villianized by either respective side. /originalohpeh](
386,"I am planning a campaign that will focus on the players being in a fantasy version of the SCP foundation, basically low magic world with rare high magic creatures/artifacts (The more existential horror leaning the better). I'd like to build a table for additional high magic 'anomalies' to show up to fill the world in addition to the more major encounters. Things that can work either as already contained when the players are exploring the base of operations or additional problems to deal with during a mission showing up would be nice.

&#x200B;

1. A resting Aboleth whose very dreams seep into the subconscious of those in nearby towns and slowly changing their thought process
2. A Kuo-toa searching for more of it's kind to spread their belief, which would cause their god to become real
3. A malfunctioning Modron who has abandoned their post and hiding out on the mortal plane
4. A book that promises rare spells in exchange for sacrifices, a mimic using it's dangerous knowledge in exchange for meals
5. An Ooze of unknown type slowly spreading to encase an area and devouring any living thing that touches it
6. There has to be a false hydra somewhere (Those targeted by it's magic get erased from the minds of everyone that knew them) --Till-3146  

7. Enormous magical monuments that dominate the skyline that no one sees because their memories of them never form."
387,"Short term madness is pretty hardcore (like you fall unconscious etc.) It lasts a few minutes, and really just provides a hardship for one fight.

Indefinite madness is pretty vanilla because it lasts forever (you now have a drinking problem, etc)

Long term madness lasts 1d10x10 hours, so potentially a few days.  This provides great roleplay with medium hardship for a session or two.  It's my favorite type of madness, and there is no d100 table for it yet.  Let's finish it!

 

1. The character feels compelled to repeat a specific activity over and over, such as washing hands, touching things, praying, or counting coins.
2. The character experiences vivid hallucinations and has disadvantage on ability checks.
3. The character suffers extreme paranoia. The character has disadvantage on Wisdom and Charisma checks.
4. The character regards something sually the source of madness) with intense revulsion, as if affected by the antipathy effect of the antipathy/sympathy spell.
5. The character experiences a powerful delusion. Choose a potion. The character imagines that he or she is under its effects.
6. The character becomes attached to a “lucky charm,” such as a person or an object, and has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws while more than 30 feet from it.
7. The character is blinded (25%) or deafened (75%).
8. The character experiences uncontrollable tremors or tics, which impose disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws that involve Strength or Dexterity.
9. The character suffers from partial amnesia. The character knows who he or she is and retains racial traits and class features, but doesn’t recognize other people or remember anything that happened before the madness took effect.
10. Whenever the character takes damage, he or she must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be affected as though he or she failed a saving throw against the confusion spell. The confusion effect lasts for 1 minute.
11. The character loses the ability to speak.

388,"My player's party were taken to an alternate reality by a multi-dimensional traveling entity, after discerning indications they weren't in Kansas anymore, they attempted casting *sending* on a previously deceased party member- AND having opened the door, I had them roll a d100. The result? 5. Pirate. Pirate \*insert deceased character here\* emerged to respond to the spell. We left off with them still figuring this all out, but after sending only 1 more *sending* to THEMSELVES. Their result on the d100? 9. Cowboy. \*insert TALKING TO COWBOY VERSION OF MYSELF\*

I took a few from the Pocket Mortys. 

Anyway, help me fill it out, hope it somehow makes its way into your own campaigns.

389,"1. Lil Jack: A handheld Jack-o-lantern that cast Fireball at it's base level when thrown. After a long rest, Lil Jack magically reforms near your resting place. 

___

2. The Pharoah's Hand Wraps: While your hands are wrapped ceremonial mummification linens, your unarmed strikes do an extra 1d6 necrotic damage against any target that is not undead.

____

3. Ghoststeps: A pair of gray and white boots that feel weightless. As an action the user can turn ethereal as per the Etherealness spell, for 30 seconds each day. The 30 seconds can be split up at the users will.

____

4. Black Cat Coin: A coin piece sculptured from onyx, with a cat engraved on bothering the front and back. Once per day you can force any roll within 30ft of you to be rerolled and the lower roll must be used. Curse: if the coin is ever lost or stolen, for 24 hours all of your rolls are made at disadvantage.

___

5. Vampires Grace: An ominously red potion that when drank, grants the user limited regeneration. The user regains 5 hit points at the start of each turn but suffers from sunlight hypersensitivity, taking 20 radiant damage if it starts its turn in direct sunlight.

___

6. Vampire Cricket: A small undead husk of an albino cricket in a tiny wicker cage filled with dusty cobwebs.  The cricket is not alive, does not move, eat normal food, breathe, or sleep, but does not actually count as an undead creature, instead it is considered an item.  The attuned user must keep the cricket fed, providing at least 1 hp of their own blood dripped onto the husk after each short or long rest.  Failure to do this puts the husk into a torpor, until such time as 24 hours have passed, with the attuned user providing 1 hp of their own blood each hour over this period.  In exchange, the cricket quietly chirps while within the presence of undead within 1000 feet (but 5 feet of water, 1 foot of stone, or 1 inch of metal blocks the effect), turning to the direction of the source and chirping faster indicating approximate range (once per minute, once per round, etc); additionally allies of the attuned user within 30 feet of the chirping, who are able to hear it, gain a +1d4 bonus to resist mind-affecting effects by the undead creature.

___

7. Disguise Glamour: Fleshy masks fully covering the head, neck and shoulders.  When worn these extremely lifelike masks transform the wearer into a very lifelike humanoid form with a head matching that of the creature the mask was modelled after, fantastical or otherwise; they are fully articulated, and feel like real flesh. They only ever work for 12 hours (technically from one sunset to the next sunrise) before melting into a puddle of goo.  Typical designs are often that of a Boars-heads, Rabbits, Felines, Overly Cute Bears, and Pumpkins; they are never able to exactly replicate the exact appearance of a specific real, living creature (for purposes of impersonation, a DC13 check can discriminate), but each mask is unique and has unique, personally identifying features.  They have the magical signature of a cantrip; cease functioning in the presence of an anti-magic field; do not confer any of the stats, powers or senses of the creature being mimicked, but also do not hinder the wearer's senses in any way.  While these are illusions, and are easily detected as such from casual observation (DC13) the material components of the mask, serve to conceal the exact identity of the individual wearing it until the mask is removed or melts.

____

8. Head of the headless horseman: a 20lb Jack o’ lantern bubbling and churning with an endless fire. The pumpkin emits a bright green light out to 30ft. A one use item. A creature can use an action to throw the Jack o’ lantern a number of feet equal to its strength modifier X 10.

A moderate wind of 10mph will dissipate the fog in 1/4 the time (15 minutes).  2nd Command.  Ground Fog:  Creates a fog at 5ft radius per turn until it covers a 500ft radius that is 2ft deep.  Ground fog completely obscures vision beyond 6 inches.

___

10. Ferryman's Cakes: These cute, flat, dense, cakes made of honey, barley, and pomegranate conceal a coin baked inside, and bear a pressed memento mori design on the outside.  They are specifically a burial offering that has transcended into a Harvest Celebrations treat for children.  Rarely, a cake is found with a gold peice inside; this gold peice, if freely given and not exchanged becomes magically attuned to the spell *Speak with Dead*, granting one additional question per coin, up to a maximum of three coins.  The coins are consumed by the spell after use.

____

11. Bag of Bountiful Confections:  An ornate leather bag, that appears to be empty.  Three times per day the wielder can pull out one of the following from the bag (candy apple, cinnamon roll, hand full of chocolates, hand full of honeyed fruits and nuts, rock candy).

In the pommel is an orange garnet carved like a Jack O' Lantern. It is a magical dagger and can hit creatures with nonmagical weapon resistance, but confers no bonus to hit or damage against most opponents. Against Plant-type creatures, however, the dagger is +2 to hit and +2 damage, and upon a successful hit will ""carve"" a wound into the target that will cause an additional 1D4 necrotic damage per round, as per a Sword of Wounding."
390,"1. Blessed Stake: Functions as a dagger. Critical hits against Vampires and Fiends deal an extra 3d6 Radiant damage.


2. Shiftersbane: (+1 revolver) Shiftersbane has 6 charges. As an action the wielder can expend 1 charge to fire the weapon at a target within 60ft, on a hit the target takes 2d6 piercing damage.

Without the key, a creature proficient with Theives' tools can pick the manacles' lock with a successful DC 17 Dexterity check. Manacles have 20 Hit points.


7. Broom-Breaker: This +1 hand ax is meant to stop fleeing witches in their tracks. When you throw this weapon at an enchanted broom, cauldron, or other such object that has been enchanted to fly you suffer no disadvantage at long range and gain advantage while in regular range.

10. Pocket Sand: it is a dirty trick that is incredibly sophomoric but, when used well, could save your life. You put a pouch of sand in your pocket and can use it to blind things for 1d2 rounds if you are in melee range. You can add or replace sand with other things like silver powder, Goofer powder, iron shavings, etc. for additional effects.


11. Goofer dust: A hexing material used in voodoo rituals. It is actually ""Kufwa"" dust but, the Lwa don't care about pronunciation and care more about effects. The dust is based on what the Lwa say you need to mix and how to mix it. The instructions may not make logical sense but, it will do what the they say it will. Just do show respect and do not backsass the Lwa.


12. An enchanted arrow fletched with a Feather from a Good Aligned Celestial:  Against an Evil aligned Undead, Outsider, Demon, Or Devil, as an arrow fired from a bow, or as an additional material component in a ranged attack spell; gain Advantage on your ranged attack or ranged spell attack, and add 1d4 to your attack roll.

391,"My campaign setting is a sprawling empty expanse with floating islands dotted here and there. 

One of the major factions is a Corprotocracy heavily inspired by the Vogons from Hitchhiker's Guide. 

Periodically, the players will need to pursue objectives on islands controlled by Corp and so I will need to have several essentially meaningless tasks they will need to carry out in order to make any progress on the Islands. 

1. Currency exchange form - the party must fill out a form to recieve Scrip as Corp does not accept Imperial or Confederacy (the other two major factions) coins.

2. Currency exchange form fee agreement - the party must agree beforehand to pay a small fee for the Currency exchange form to be provided, as it normally needs to be paid for in Scrip

3. Temporary Visitation License form - the party must apply for a temporary license which will allow them access to the majority of the island

4. Temporary Visitation License fee deferral form - the party must agree to pay a small fee for the deferral of payment for the Temporary Visitation License form until such time as they are able to pay for it in Scrip. 

5. Harbor Rental form - the party must pay in advance, a non refundable deposit to rent a mooring at the Harbor. 

6. Harbor Rental Fee Deferral form - the partymust agree to pay a small fee for the deferral of payment for the Harbor Rental Deposit until such time as they are able to pay for it in Scrip. 

7. General Laborer Registration form 199b - A form to request a new General Laborer Registration Number if you are the parent / guardian of the individual 

8. General Laborer Registration form 199c - a form to request a new General Laborer Registration Number if all of the the parents / guardians of the individual have died in a non work related accident within the last week.

9. General Laborer Registration form 199d - a form to request a new General Laborer Registration Number if all of the the parents / guardians  of the individual have died in a work related accident within the last week. 

10. General Laborer Registration form 199e - a form to request a new General Laborer Registration Number if all of the the parents / guardians  of the individual have died in a work related accident not within the last week. 

11. General Laborer Registration form 199g - a form to request a new General Laborer Registration Number if all of the the parents / guardians of the individual have died in a non work related accident not within the last week.

11. General Laborer Registration form 199p - a form to request a new General Laborer Registration Number if you are applying for yourself. 

12. General Laborer Registration form 199z - a form to request a new General Laborer Registration Number if you are applying for yourself and you are in the custody of another to whom you are in debt.

(These are mostly so that I can be really ambiguous about which form they need to fill out) 

13. Personal Property Declaration form 625a - the party must declare all of their personal property upon entering the Settlement. 

14. Personal Property Declaration form 625b - the party must declare any weaponry they are planning on bringing into the Settlement, and consent to an extremely thorough search, which is only referenced to in Disclosure Agreement 843 k. 

15. Disclosure Agreement 843 k - the Signee consents to a full body search at any time for any reason. Failure to comply will result in Immediate Termination of Employment and Forfiture of all Scrip in your possession. 

16. Personal Property Retention Agreement 626b - the party agrees to pay an up front, non refundable, deposit of X gp per weapon they declared in form 625b. The party also agrees to pay any damages caused by the retention of said weapons, including to Corp Property (which includes any party under Corp Employment)

17. Ring of Sealing Requisition form G448 - the party will gain access to the use of a Ring of Sealing (an attunment ring that allows you to use a reaction to store your soul inside of it in case of... accidental death) 

18. Reincarnation Requisition Agreement G449a - the party can agree to pay a non-transferable,  non-refundable deposit to be used in the event that an accidental death occurs during work activities as long as they successfully utilized their requisitioned Ring of Sealing, and the Ring is able to be recovered

19. Reincarnation Requisition Agreement G449b - the party can agree to pay a (much larger) non-transferable,  non-refundable deposit to be used in the event that an accidental death occurs during non work activities as long as they successfully utilized their requisitioned Ring of Sealing, and the Ring is able to be recovered"
392,"The gang is currently in the most high-tech kingdom in the world, one that toes the line between steampunk and dieselpunk. They're also in one of its large cities, dealing with quarantined areas from a mysterious plague (and being kept mostly on the downlow and downplayed from the public eye) that drives people to levels of insanity to borderline feral. I'll happily roll with jobs that are everyday stuff or plague-related.

1. Petting zoo attendant-the local amusement park has lost one of their attendants working at the petting zoo and needs someone good with animals. Try and keep some of the more fantastical ones from setting the children on fire or turning them into stone, please.
2. Bandits in the skies-a gang of pirates keep raiding out airships just outside the city; eradicate or arrest them, we're not picky on which.
3. Bait-and-Switch-A private investigator is trying to set up a sting operation to lure out someone they're investigating, but they've already been spotted and recognized. They need a stand-in to do so while they wait on the sidelines ready to jump into action.
4. Scavenging for Parts-an engineer claims to be scavenging for parts for the robot he's building, but is actually a mad scientist attempting to bring someone back from the dead with an automaton body and needs fresh organs for his experiment-the job offer is just his way of requesting unwitting delivery.
5. Need some influencers-an up-and-coming local bar is requesting some people to come review their food and live entertainment to help bolster their reputation and spread the word. Bonus points if something happens to the live entertainment and the adventurers have to sub in themselves."
393,"I'm planning on running a mech focused TTRPG and I'd like to have a table i can roll to add some flavour to less important enemies that the players will fight a lot. Feel free to comment less serious modifications, the setting allows pretty much any background for mech pilots, so don't just think of what a seasoned veteran military dude would put on his mech.


I'll start: 


##d100 Cosmetic/Low impact modifications made to a mech

1. A skull of an alien creature or a collection of skulls of various alien creatures are attached to a part or parts of a mech.

2. The mech is littered with small splashes of paint  that seem like they were made by someone shooting at the mech with a paintball gun.

3. The mech is plastered in stickers of various cartoon characters popular in this star system.

4. Some parts of the mech menace with rows of metal spikes.

5. There is a tap that outputs a drink attached to the mech. The drink is spewed everywhere when the mech is destroyed.

6. /AxionSalvo) A cattle catcher : advantage to deflect projectiles from a vulnerable area. Smells faintly of rotten meat. 

7. A holosphere: illuminated projection from it's eyepieces: can deliver a custised message.

8. Two pink elephants painted in an abstract style. You feel a bit woozy if you look at them too long.

9. A binary bubble blower: bubbles appear in the form of ones and zeroes that can be read, if you are fast.

10. A star launcher: leaves a beautiful light show that fizzes into the air. Embellishment for any attack. 

11. Reflective sensor array: Remote projectile detection. Looks like an antique hand held mirror. 

12. A tapestry: hangs from the mechs torso, depicting gods from a long lost era. Said to protect those that believe it works.

13. /Adventux) Apply to two mechs: One is painted like a man in a tuxedo, the other is painted like a bride

14. /World_Of_Ideas) Animal Motif - The mech's physical design or the artwork on it resembles an animal (bear, bird, cat, fox, kangaroo, lizard, rat, wolf, etc)

15. Bright Color - This thing is blindingly bright neon (green, orange, pink yellow). You need shades to keep from being blinded.

16. Piecemeal / Junkyard / Frankenstein Mech - Appears to be cobbled together from parts of several different mechs.

17. Cargo Hauler - The mech has a large cargo container strapped to its back. Could be anything in the container (cargo, portable house, portable lab, portable workshop, spare parts, etc)

18. Construction Mech - It looks like it was originally designed for construction work or cargo lifting and was modified to it's current purpose. It may still have an excavator arm attached.

19. Fireworks Launcher - At least one of the weapon systems has been replaced with a fireworks launcher. At best its good for distracting the enemy or signaling allies.

20. Graffiti - Some graffiti artist has painted all over this mech.

21. Kicken Sound System - It has a lot of high quality speakers on it. When this guy plays his music, you can hear it from orbit.

22. Kill Stickers - The mech has a long list of kill stickers on it. They are fake, this guy is trying to intimidate people.

23. Kill Stickers (non-nonsensical) - The mech has a lot of kill stickers, but they aren't for mechs. They are for (deer, dogs, S Marts, Volkswagen bugs, etc)

24. Knight Motif - The mech is designed to look like a knight in plate armor or its paint job makes it look that way.

25. Raider Prisoners - There are living people in cages attached to the outside of the mech. The evil bastard is using them as a shield.

26. Rust Bucket - The exterior of this mech makes it look like it's about to fall apart. The metal is pitted and corroded, there are even a few spots that look like they holes in the armor.

27. Samurai Motif - The mech is designed to resemble samurai armor.

28. Skeletal Motif - The mech is thin and skeletal in design or its paint job makes it look that way.

29. Warded - The mech is covered in Chinese paper seals to ward off bad luck, misfortune, and evil spirits.

31. /Superfluous_Yam) Positive Caricature: The mech is painted to resemble a local politician or celebrity that the user admires.

32. Negative Caricature: The mech is painted to mock a local politician or celebrity that the user dislikes.

33. Camouflage: The mech is painted in a camo pattern. This may or may not actually make it harder to target.

34. Mom: The mech has ""I <3 Mom"" painted in big letters across the front

35. /World_Of_Ideas) Battle Scarred - The armor is covered with cuts, dents, bullet holes, blast marks, and burn marks. There is a lot of patchwork field repairs covering the worst of the damage. This thing has seen some action.

36. Corporate Mascot - The mech is a corporate mascot. Even though it is a fully functional mech, it was never meant to see real battle. Someone may have added weapons to it. (emergency use / used by someone who stole it / Based on anime series: Dai-Guard)

37. Electrical Short - There is an electrical short in a few of the less important systems. Sparks can occasionally be seen between the gaps in the armor. Anyone who touches the outer hull gets zapped enough to make their arm tingle.

38. Leaking - There is something leaking out from the gaps in the armor. (coolant, fire extinguisher foam, hydraulic fluid, oil, etc)

39. Melted Candle - At some point some kind of ablative armor was used. Hits from lasers have melted sections of the outer armor causing it to run down the sides, giving the mech the appearance of melted wax.

40. Museum Piece - The mech is an older model that is no longer in production. It may be an antique, but it's still functional. May or may not have some of the weapon systems replaced with more modern systems.

41. Organic - The mech was made using some kind of bio-tech. The parts were grown rather than manufactured. It also resembles a living creature rather than a construct of metal alloys.

42. Smoking - The mech belches out plumes of grey or black smoke from its exhaust system.

43. Student Driver - There is a big sign painted on the front and back proclaiming that this is a student pilot.

44. /The_Inward) The mech is painted in a way that resembles an old forgotten character named ""Hello Kitty"", it seems like she still has some fans around

45. /latenightzen) Pin-up art painted under the cockpit window.

46. Red light runner - the mech has bent and broken stop signs welded to its legs.

47. Hotrod - flame paint scheme.

48. 'Sucks to be you' is painted on a missile hatch.

49. Cat ears on the cockpit.

50. /World_Of_Ideas) Action Star - The mech is surrounded by a small swarm of camera drones. They appear to be filming the mech itself. Also, the mech tends to make unnecessary dramatic poses and while its movements might look good on film they aren't the best for actual combat.

51. Boots - Padded footwear has been attached, so it doesn't damage roads when it walks on them.

394,"In Kobold Press' ""Tales of Old Margreve"", there is a map of Baba Yaga's hut. Bigger on the inside, this hut includes many doors that open to other locations. One room has 'Doors to Random Places' and another is an infinite hallway with 'doors to other huts'.

Assuming the adventurers survive long enough to explore a witch's hut, what are some random rooms one might encounter while opening these portals to other locations? Funny, dark, mysterious, or just weird.

I'll give a few to start...

\##d100 Random Rooms in a Witch's Hut

1. The door swings open to reveal a darkly lit room of unknown size. A light from above beams down to illuminate a dog sitting in a chair. It's limbs are tied to the chair and a gag is wrapped around it's snout. Eyes wide with fear, it seems to beg you for help. But before you can react, a cat steps into the light, sits for a moment and speaks, ""Move along visitor. This doesn't concern you."" And with that, the door slowly closes on it's own. You pause for a moment to consider what you just witnessed, and wonder if it was real at all. \[/AndrewRP8023\]
2. Swinging open, this door reveals an empty 15x15 room. A quick sweep reveals that the room is indeed empty, including the corners, ceiling, and behind the door. Disappointed, you turn to leave, only to catch movement out of the corner of your eye. Giving the room another search, you cannot determine where the movement came from, or if something is actually there. Backing out of the room, you gently close the door. Right before it shuts, you hear a child-like whisper from the crack of the door that says, ""Goodbye!"" Shivers run down your spine as the door latch closes. \[/AndrewRP8023\]
3. Opening the door, you discover a rather lavishly decorated 25x25 bed chamber. Red wall paper with gold accents are completed with with a very large four-poster bed, several dressers, a chaise lounge, coffee table, and grand looking chandeliers with candles. Standing next to the bed is a fully grown, adult horse. Wearing pajamas. It turns to look at you for a moment before turning back to to the bed and climbing on top of it where it lays down and whinnies before closing its eyes, seemingly having gone to sleep. You gently close the door and turn away, wondering just how a horse got into pajamas. \[/AndrewRP8023\]
4. This door opens to what appears to be a 20x20 manufacturing and storage room for dolls. The walls are lined with shelves full of small porcelain dolls. A large table dominates the center of the room where bolts of cloth, sewing tools, and various props and accessors are piled. You notice a few cages hung from the ceiling with dolls in them, looks of horror and fear on their surprisingly detailed faces. Not a sound is made, nor is there any movement at all as you stand in the door frame, surveying the room and the dolls. You can't help but wonder if you should step in, or out and close the door. \[/AndrewRP8023\]
5. The room beyond this door appears to be a regular sitting room. A coffee table is in the center of the room with several high-backed chairs. A plate of cookies and a pot of coffee sit on the table. Paintings of serene landscapes decorate the walls, and beautiful carpets are laid out under the furniture. You can smell the cookies from the doorway--your favorite! And steam rolls out of the spout of the coffee pot (or is that a tea pot), giving the impression that it's freshly brewed. The room looks like an excellent place for a short rest. \[/AndrewRP8023\]
6. Opening the door, you see a group of children dressed in makeshift medical clothing gathered around an operating table with an adult body lying on top. The body cavity is open and they appear to be performing a surgery. They all pause to look at you, and one asks if you are the organ donor as another pushes a wheelchair over and invites you to sit. \[/NecessaryCornflake7\]
7. You open the door to a room filled with children's toys and games. There is a bed in one corner and a wood burning stove in the opposite corner, ostensibly for heating the room. \[/Adventux\]
8. The door opens to a room full of mirrors. When a mirror is touched your reflection changes the color and type of garb that you are wearing. (Stats do not change, only the visual appearances.) \[/AwkwardTRexHub\]
9. The door opens into an archery range. A number of ranged weapons are arrayed on the walls and tables. Several beings (ethereal, puppets, etc) are in the room preparing weapons or firing them at a line of targets at the end of the firing rang. The targets are human shaped and swaddled in bloody cloths, some struggling weakly, others hang limply above pools of blood. \[/Kiyohara\]
10. The door opens into a library. The books are all seemingly normal, but there's always something off about them. They always have the villain win, have slightly (or significantly) evil plots, or tell stories from the villain's perspective. Many are histories, fairy tales, or mythologies subtly rewritten to show how the evilest of people were correct or necessary for the events to happen. More than a few have notes in the margins that further expound on the points raised, with comments like ""make sure to do this,"" or ""stop doing this, see?"" \[/Kiyohara\]
11. The door opens into the very room the players are in. Describe it in detail with descriptions of the players themselves (be nice), the playing field, character sheets, books, furniture, etc. If possible, text a housemate to kick the door in at this exact moment. \[/Kiyohara\]
12. The door opens into a room filled with one of the character's family. It is a warm, happy setting, with the family calling out to the person who opened the door in greetings. The table is set for a typical dinner, with the most homely and nostalgic of smells. There is room for everyone at the table and the smiles are genuine and true. (Obviously, this will set off alarm bells in most adventurers given their typically tragic backgrounds. Have fun!) \[/Kiyohara\]
13. The door opens to nothing. The very embodiment of a void. No air, sound, temperature, movement, light.... nothing. It is nothing and empty of reality. Every sense the party has tells them not to enter. \[/Kiyohara\]
14. The door opens to an abattoir. Blood glistens on the floor and is splattered across walls. Several tables are heaped with cut meat of various creatures, while hooks hanging from the ceiling dangle whole sides and full skinned creatures. Several butchers are seen moving about cutting meat and slicing off portions for cooking. Most are well muscled and carry wicked looking knives, butcher's cleavers, and meat hooks. The floor is messy and covered in the detritus of butchery: discarded offal, blood, and the better left nameless filth that is left when things are slaughtered. It is up to the GM if the creatures or meat is sinister in nature or simply animals being prepared for normal consumption. \[/Kiyohara\]
15. The door opens to a backstage area. Actors run about in varying stages of dress while others mumble their lines worriedly. Stage hands are busy trying to get people out or are wrestling with scenery and props. The director sees the party and urgently gestures for them to take their places. \[/Kiyohara\]
16. The door opens into a warm and inviting bath house. Large pools of heated water send steam clouds rising, while the air is filled with the sweet scent of extensive oils and incense. A collection of bath oils, soaps, and cleansers sit off to the side next to a stack of the fluffiest towels ever seen. A sauna can be seen off to one side, as well as an archway to an outdoor pool that shows of mountain snowscape. Sofas mate of rattan wood sit around, perfect for lounging next to warm braziers and buckets of ice containing bottles of some delectable mead, wine, and ale. \[/Kiyohara\]
17. The door opens and standing on the other side is a nearly identical group of people to the party. They vary slightly in color palate (hair, eyes, skin or clothing) but otherwise seem to have the same (or similar) classes and relatively similar gear. The door closes on its own, leaving both parties confused. \[/Kiyohara\]
18. The door opens into a plain looking stone room lit from above by a simple hanging lantern. The room has a cell on one end occupied by a large, naked humanoid form with pale white skin and limbs far longer than what a proportionate human would be. The creature is facing away from the party, but seems docile and does not react even to violence. On the table is a vial with a thought strand labeled ""For your eyes only."" \[/Robotic_Space_Camel\]
19. The door swings outward into a room of a dozen or so beds with belongings tucked away into bags underneath each bed. Investigation reveals that the room is a dormitory for an orphanage in one of the major cities the party has visited. \[/Robotic_Space_Camel\]
20. The open door reveals a room of unspecified size that is full to the brim with spiders and wasps. The individual creatures are mundane except for the fact that they are seemingly able to exist in a room packed full of other creatures and are not hostile to each other. The spiders and wasps seem to be composed of all numbers of species and are not hostile to the party except in response to being aggravated. Once the has been opened, the creatures spill out of the doorway at a rate similar to flood waters and the party must succeed on an athletics check to force the door closed again. \[/Robotic_Space_Camel\]
21. The door opens to reveal a room full of bones, some of which seem to be human, used by the witch in her magic. If you stay there too long, some of the bones start forming into animated skeletons. \[/Chekaman\]
22. A cauldron is brewing in the middle of this room, with the surrounding space occupied with shelves upon shelves of various bottles, vials, and jars. But your faze locks to a particular table with a distiller. Above it hangs a small ghastly figure, hair over face, with translucent silver threads binding it to the table. Tubes run from the figure to the distiller. \[/Major_Kolz\]
23. This door opens on a remote cottage herb garden as if you exited the cottage itself. The garden surrounds the cottage and is neatly organized including name tags on all the plantings. Every herb here is used in herbal remedies, poisons, and magical potions. The setting is peaceful and the weather is perfect here. If you stay long enough, you notice the sun doesn't move. \[/DarthJazzHands\]
24. Opening the door reveals the back side of the party from the door behind then. If the party turns to look behind them, they see the opposite door is open and themselves on the other side. If they step through either door, they enter the hallway they're already in, behind themselves. There is no limit to how many times they may pass through the doors, always arriving in the same hallway, but from the other side. Closing one door, closes both. Opening either door again, opens to a different room on this list. \[/AndrewRP8023\]
25. This door opens into a bath room. It is simply furnished with standard accoutrements. There is a privacy screen in one corner and the sound of a woman singing to herself can be heard. There are fancy looking clothing folded and laid on a table nearby and silk underwear can be seen laying over the top of the privacy screen. The shadows on the screen give the impression of an thin, attractively shaped woman, in a tub, washing herself. The only disconcerting thing is if the characters look closely enough, the 'water' on the floor is actually blood. \[/AndrewRP8023\]
26. The door opens into a room of metal walls and floors. The far wall, across from the door the party opened, has some odd looking vents in it that may require closer inspection. Otherwise the walls and floor seem to be solidly welded together. The floor has many large scrapes in it from something being pushed or moved across the floor towards the far wall. If the party enters, the door behind them slams shut and locks. The room then slowly begins to raise in temperature. After a few minutes, the vents at the far end open, revealing a massive set of eyes looking in for a brief moment before the vent is closed again. The room will heat to a final temperature of about 350F/176C degrees for about an hour and a half, after which time the far wall will tilt down and the figure on the outside will extract whatever remains of the party. \[/Kiyohara\]
27. The door opens to the front exit of the hut. Whatever was outside when the party ventured in is there now. Without warning, they are abruptly forced out and the door closes behind them. They may of course re-enter, but will do so from the outside of the hut into whatever main or first room was the one they originally entered into. \[/Kiyohara\]
28. The door opens into a well house. The walls are stone and moss covered, while the floor is bare hard packed dirt. A stone well sits in the center with a wooden bucket, crossbar, and many feet of rope. Faint dripping sounds can be heard from the well with a distinct echo. A long distant splash can be heard, but only faintly as if it was at a distance--or meant to be silent. Careful eyes will notice a faint marking near the edge of the stone well in the dirt, as if something was dragged or pulled suddenly towards the well. \[/Kiyohara\]
29. The door opens into a stairway leading down into a cellar. There is a faint scent of mildew and a sweet-sout scent of mild rot. Dust rises from the stairs as the air flows around them. THe faint light cast down the stairs is just enough to illuminate many crates, boxes, and jars (ostensibly of food goods stored), but not enough for any detail. The stairs themselves are rickety, with open backs that stare into pure darkness. The cold from below leaks out to the party at the top and chills their skin without even needing to enter. \[/Kiyohara\]
30. The door opens into a sitting room, set for tea. Aside from the tea table and several chairs about it, every shelf, table, chair, counter, window sill, mantle, or other surface is covered with dolls. Some are tiny and could fit in a man's hand, while some are as large as a small child. Many thousand dolls with porcelain faces back at the party with cold black eyes. THeir hand painted faces are each unique and distinct and eerily familiar. Their dress ranges from mundane to exquisitely fancy while their hair styles seem a touch out of fashion, yet impeccable well done. A faint scratching noise can be heard, almost as that of ceramic slightly moving. \[/Kiyohara\]
31. The door opens into a room made entirely out of sweets. Candies, cakes, pies, sugary treats, tarts, chocolates--everything. Caramel seems to be used as mortar, candy floss as fabrics, and gingerbread make up the planking. Hard candies stand in for stones in the flooring and hearth, while brittles and planks of cookie make up the tables and countertops. One can even feel (and taste) the fluffy marshmallow cushions and pillows that sit in the various chairs and sofas. The one thing that seems to not be made from candy and sugar is an ominous black oven that sits hulking in the shadows at the rear of the kitchen. \[/Kiyohara\]
32. This door reveals a rather plain looking 5 foot by 5 foot water closet or restroom. A simple vanity with sink and mirror on one side, and a rather ordinary looking ceramic toilet on the other side, with the lid down. A small sconce on the wall provides light, and a bouquet of flowers on a shelf provide a nice floral scent. The party notices nothing out of the ordinary, and no odd sounds emanate from anything. The only strange thing is half the party sees the toilet paper hanging back to front, and the other half sees it hanging front to back. \[/AndrewRP8023\]
33. As you open the door, you find yourself staring eye to eye with the witch in her dressing room. The witch is in the middle of changing, and is in a rather fetching looking night gown, which may be a bit uncharacteristic depending on the witch's appearance and apparent age. If the party does not immediately close the door, the witch will smile sweetly, give the closest character a wink and say, ""Oh my, dearie... I didn't think you were that kind of deviant. Would you like to see more?"" \[/AndrewRp8023\]
34. You open the door to find yourself standing in your home's bedroom, fortress suite, standard room at the inn, or other safe haven that the witch should definitely not have access to. If the party steps through, the door closes behind them, and only opens to whatever would normally be on the other side of the door. There is no way to cause it to open back to the witch's hut. \[/AndrewRP8023\]
35. The door opens to reveal a grand throne room. Marble pillars, fancy tapestries, exotic furniture, and lots and lots of people in the finest of garments--who all turn to regard you with surprise. You notice a king and queen in the back staring at you with shock on their faces... a moment later you register all the guards rushing towards you, with weapons drawn. \[/AndrewRP8023\]
36. The door swings open to reveal a dark and damp cave. The air reeks with the scent of death and decay prominent. There are bones of unknown, and some known, creatures in piles near the door on either side. You hear a low growl and the sound of foot falls as something further back in the cave begins to run towards you. \[/AndrewRP8023\]
37. The door opens to empty darkness. There are no walls, ceilings, or floor. Anyone stepping through the door falls. There is no bottom. \[/AndrewRP8023\]
38. The door opens to a grand treasure room 50 feet wide and perhaps a hundred feet long. The walls are 50 feet high, with piles of gold and platinum nearly as high. Art objects, jewelry, gems, and expensive looking clothing are scattered about and interspersed with the gold and platinum. Statues of solid gold are staggered here and there, mostly of people in kneeling, or bending positions. There is a sign front and center in beautiful calligraphy that reads, ""Free Samples! One per visitor!"" \[/AndrewRP8023\]
39. This door reveals a simple but small 5x5 room with a little coffee table in the center. Upon it are a plate of cookies and a glass of milk. The cookies have a little card next to them that reads, ""Eat me,"" and the glass of milk has a card next to it that reads, ""Drink me."" \[/AndrewRP8023\]
40. This door opens to reveal a typical office environment. A water cooler stand to one side near the restrooms. A glass wall reveals a conference room beyond with a large table and a projection screen. Desks are pressed together creating a maze. And everywhere, there are life-size spiders. Some are typing away at computers or typewriters, some are reading newspapers, some are gossiping at the water cooler, and some are carrying packages and bundles of papers back and forth. After a moment, they all stop their activity and turn to stare at you. The closest one nearby asks, ""Are you the new interns? Or the lunch delivery?"" \[/AndrewRP8023\]
41. The doors slowly flows open on its own and reveals a small room just big enough for a small table, and a couple of chairs. Tapestries and curtains decorate the walls, and a small chandelier provides dim light. Seated at the table, on the opposite side, is an older woman with a deck of cards, a tea set, a bowl of knucklebones, and a small crystal ball. She smiles sweetly at you and asks, ""Hello there. Who is first to hear their fortune? Please, step in and take a seat. Do close the door behind you. I prefer to work in private with my clients."" \[/AndrewRP8023\]

397,"""I saw a [post]( a while back regarding Litch Phylactery ideas and I was shocked it was not on here. After doing a search, I see this is a blind spot on this subreddit. So I figured... I might as well make it.

So: A Phylactery is defined as an object used to store a monster's soul to protect it from death as introduced by the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game and now ubiquitous within fantasy fiction.

For this list, I will be collecting ideas for things that a creature (Litch) might make into their Phylactery. Make them boring and mundane. Make them intricate and clever. Make them ornate and spectacular. I'll try not to have too many repeats (sorry if your suggestion fits too closely to one already) but let me have your ideas!  

I also want to shout out Pointy Hat's Videos on the Litch types for [Bards]( and [Sorcerers]( as their ideas on Phylacteries are amazing.""

7. A doctor's bag (of holding), all who die in its presence are automatically fed to it, meaning very rarely is it ever suspected. [/comedianmasta]
8. A Dorian Grey style painting, the visage of it grows darker and more horrid with every soul fed to it. It depicts the litch in their original form, but the litch can never look at it or risk undoing the effects. [/comedianmasta]
9. A massive, magically enchanted tree where an entire community has built their home / staked their livelyhood around. [/comedianmasta]
10. One of the 1D100 trinkets a player chose or rolled for at the start of the campaign. Every kill (of a soul) this player has done has been feeding it. [/comedianmasta]
11. A King or Queen's Crown (or Crown Jewel) [/comedianmasta]
12. The mast of an ancient sailing ship, sunk at the bottom of the ocean guarded by sea life. Ships wrecked above have some of their sailors sacrificed to feed it. [/comedianmasta]

Now it's not that hard to destroy, but in doing so everyone who drank from the fountain loses its benefits. The party could be responsible for mass genocide. Maybe they themselves or one of their family members drank from it. Maybe the royalty did, why not add regicide to that growing list of terrible consequences [/Vampinoy]
35. A soul store gem. Smashing it destroys the lich, but releases the tarrasque [/alonewithpippin]

40. Make it a dragon's fake tooth, but like one of the one's in the back, so that even if the PCs kill the dragon it's unlikely that they'll loot EVERY single tooth [/Jaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn]
41. Give it to a god of the dead as a tribute where it can ambiently devour souls that drift past the hoard of treasures it sits with like the vault in the Dresden Files novels [/Jaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn]
42. A perpetually levitating hail stone that hides in clouds [/Jaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn]
43. A drop of adamantine,contained in a small lead ball, inside a 1 inch thick marble of iron, contained in a 1 foot thick sphere of shale or granite stone, all sealed one over the other getting rid of the seams and sealed in something made of 3 feet of wood. If you continue with the spherical aspect then you will have a 4 foot wooden sphere that is only a bit heavy. For something a little extra, you can get it silvered and somehow atune the object to a ""amulet of proof against detection and location"", as well as a permanent casting of the nondetection spell. [/Emotional_Guillotine]
44. An Automaton's power source [/BaronvonDochelein]
45. A ship made entirely of the bones of humans and humanoid creatures. Alternatively, in the Spelljammer setting, possibly just the ship's helm is the phylactery [/Chad_Hooper]

50. An orb of dragon kind [/Leif-Colbry]
51. The moon [/Chrontius]
52. A cast iron pot [/Leif-Colbry]
53. An astral dreadnought [/Leif-Colbry]

61. A tapestry [/Leif-Colbry]
62. A needle inside an egg, which is inside a duck, the duck is within a hare and the hare is in a chest buried deep on an island far from land. Basically what Koschei the Deathless, the likely inspiration for liches did with his soul. You open the chest, the hare starts escaping. You kill the hare, the duck flies away. Then you need to figure it out about the egg. [/Arabidopsidian]
63. The wizard's little finger bone, stashed in a random tree in a forest. [/RedwoodRhiadra]

398,"After Playing Pizza Tower I’m in the Mood  to Create a Sillier Version of My D100 Boss list. Leave Your Wackiest Silliest Boss Fight Ideas in The Comments 

1. The Bride - Her family paid for the temple, three taverns were engaged in providing food and drinks, the local Bard's Guild provided their best performers, the Groom was well-chosen, if nervous. Your pack of murderhob brave adventurers stormed through the town on the night before the big day and trashed the place in their pursuit of some evil dragon or whatever. The Groom fled, never to be seen again, the Bard's Guild claimed that they'd already drunk their deposit, which meant the taverns no longer have enough drink. The Bride is furious and wants revenge. She's a high ranking mage. 

2. The Mad Clown - He's actually a Demon who enjoys terrorizing his victims, but is obsessed with baloons and loves them a LOT.  He's so strong that you can't actually beat him in a straight up fight, but there's a lot of baloons in the boss fight arena and your party has to pop them to eventually bring him down. If you kill enough balloons he just gets incredibly depressed and leaves. Or possibly every baloon killed he gets weaker and then you can actually kill him.

3. The King/Queen's Court: A cabal of vampire aristocrats with a very unique tradition. For one week every year, they elect a mortal to be the king or queen of the vampires. They will bring the mortal back to their estate and treat them like royalty, giving them whatever they want for free. However, the mortal is not allowed to leave the estate. And at the end of that week, they all kill and eat the monarch. A party member or someone close to the party has been chosen. 

4. The Shadow. He was there that day you saved the town. He was in the crowd when you stopped those bandits. When the merchant was waylaid and almost killed by goblins, he was there, in the brush, watching as you saved him. Your favorite dagger is missing. Maybe you lost it in that fight with the giant, but, more likely, he has it. A momento stolen while you slept. What does he want? Only he knows, but you have a notion. From the shadows of the darkest depths you hear him softly say...We've been trying to reach you about your horse's extended warranty. 

5. The Lycanlycant: a size large lycanthanthropeic monstrosity that becomes size huge when it transforms, it has the innate ability to force licanthropey in humanoids as well as reverse lycanthanthropy in animals. Causing animals to transform into humanoids. 

6. Bot from God: a construct that is large enough to weald a fantasy MRI machine on a stick and a rail gun 

7. Hank Scorpio: This guy is an AMAZING boss and all-around guy. He genuinely cares about his employees, has established an almost utopian town for them to live in, and has created a work environment that both challenges and inspires his employees. And he has a FANTASTIC job opportunity for the PCs!
Shame he's bent on world domination.... 

8. Skeleton Mosh Pit- A necromancer and his cronies are protecting a McGuffin. They've taken to an elevated platform surrounded by skeletons they're animating with their music. The skeletons ignore you until you enter the pit area. The only way to move through the pit is to shove or attack skeletons that will do the same if you're within 5 feet. Skeletons reassemble at the start of their next round. Each band member you're able to stop from performing makes the skeletons take a round longer to reassemble. Stopping all of the members causes the skeletons to turn on the band and attack the surviving members. Taking the McGuffin causes the skeletons to turn to dust. 

9. Garfanzo the Wizard:  he randomly shows up at the beginning and casts random wild magic spells and fails what he wants to do at the beginning but near the end he gets stronger and starts being a actual monster or bad guy"

400,"I've finally completed Fey Encounter Table I've been working on for about a year, still not the best and I'd gladly accept any ideas/improvements you Guys might have, in any case, feel free to use them in your campaign.

&#x200B;

01 -	02 = Party spots Fey equivalent of Death that looks right back at them.

03 -	04 = This fey-region is feared for the lair of a dreaded Centipedes; a many legged creature covered in copper scales. (Use a Behir, but replace it's breath weapons with that of Copper Dragon of appropriate CL). Beware, for five of them have spawned a never-before-seen Nicklepede! (Use a Behir, but replace with the Silver Dragon's breath weapons).

05 -	06 = A patch of woods magically embiggens you (and your gear, but not your mount of vehicles). Your mounts are spooked.

07 -	08 = Party meets a lone Kelpie, it'll either attack the party, or turn into water and soak into the soil.

09 -	10 = Giant overgrown Summerwolf (think Winter Wolf but for spring), it is usually asleep, rare plants and critters found home in his mossy fur.

11 -	12 = Swarm of crows cursing players and pecking them, if attacked they disperse with a cackle.

13 -	14 = Earth that PC's stand on turns into a huge turtle that will start to walk in seemingly random direction.

15 -	16 = Dryad's garden (Fey Side Quests #1)

17 -	18 = PC's notice patch of glowing plants, if interacted it will spawn D20 of light sprites that will follow players for d6 hours, during that time they shed bright light for 10ft and dim light for another 5ft making sneaking difficult (Sneak disadvantage)

19 -	20 = Herd of giant sheep, if touched, person is afflicted with sleep spell DC 18

21 -	22 =  Sudden wind whispers things to PC's ears.

23 -	24 = A swarm of Pikmin decide to carry you and your comrades somewhere for some inscrutable reason.

25 -	26 = The immediate area around PC's sprouts flowers, if anyone attempts to pick them up, flowers would quickly hide in the soil.

27 -	28 = Party stumbles upon a massive tree stump with a hole large enough for a person to pass, there will be a small dungeon/trial inside.

29 -	30 = Dryad blocking the way (Fey Side Quests #2)

31 -	32 = A capricious and powerful fey appears. They curse a party member until they complete some strange task. Curses could be swap gender or can only speak in rhymes, tasks could be collect 100 sea shells or to eat a poison mushroom.

33 -	34 = A patch of woods magically shrinks you (and your gear, but not your mount or vehicles) to mouse, insectile, or microscopic proportions.

35 -	36 = Sudden Killer Rabbit Attack

37 -	38 = Cultists (Fey Side Quests #3)

39 -	40 = Out of clear skies a storm awakes and follows the party.

41 -	42 = A tree dances, never moves upon the ground, but the branches sway with the rhythm, but the stronger the wind, the louder the fey music in the area.

43 - 44 = Random large object in the distance moves slightly but enough for PC's to notice.

45 -	46 = Plants/trees start to turn as PC's move past them.

47 -	48 =  Two groups of tiny/small sized fey are at 'war' over a hamlet or village. One group is there playing pranks on the villagers and generally harassing them, the other is there to stymie them. For both sides, this is the point of the exercise - any harm/help they do to the actual villagers is incidental, the fun comes from annoying the other group and the villagers are just a means to an ends. You could set this up as classic good on one side, evil on the other (with the PCs helping the 'good' fey). Or you could go for something more complicated, like two sets of chaotic neutral fey opposed to each other and possible raise some moral quandaries about catching/killing creatures for what are minor pranks.

49 -	50 = Resting Place w/ Pranks.

51 -	52 = A tied up elf in the foliage, find a key DC 16, when you come back the elf is gone, can be found in a local bar, still tied up, enjoying a cold beer through the straw.

53 -	54 = A beautiful field of flowers, until you look closer and realize it’s a community of little fey who look like flowers and are sick and tired of larger beings sniffing them and trying to pick them.

55 -	56 = Overgrown stone archway that if passed through will send you to the Garden where Dark Lilies Bloom.

57 -	58 = A rosy-pink fog rises, which smells of flowers and unbridled joy. Even dangerous things seem somehow fun and safe. The party may become separated and lost in gleeful abandon.

59 -	60 = Dryad resting in a field. Arms out, enjoying the sun. If the party is friendly, she may offer directions or another small boon. If hostile, she will be joined by Needle Spawns and/or Vine Blights

61 -	62 = Area around you turns into Twilight and Night Fey come out to play

63 -	64 = The forest has literally sprouted musical instruments that play, along with every forest animal and magical monster joining in, either dancing, or playing along. A large patch is particularly catchy, and it urges you to join the dance, now that it is too late to leave. Fail to traverse the patch in graceful dance, could cause the dangerous beasts to turn on you.

65 -	66 = Firbolg named Burden (Fey Side Quests #4)

67 -	68 = Blink Dog wants to play fetch. Approaches the party with with something in its mouth. Rushes forward, drops it, and blinks back before anyone can react. The small, well chewed, wooden figurine needs to be thrown. Dog will play for a few min or run off if the players act hostile

69 -	70 = Magical pool with waterfalls coming from who knows where, dryad bathing in it, if spooked she'll disappear.

71 -	72 = A flash flood springs out of nowhere, threatening to wash you and your comrades away; and each salty drop is filled with infectious sorrow and lament. The source may be somewhere nearby.

73 -	74 = Within dense woods, a group of young Satyr are holding a raucous party - drinking, music, dancing and magical tricks/games - inside a circle of large, misshapen standing stones. If approached with friendly intent and/or gifts they will allow the PCs access through the circle to join their party. If approached with hostile intent and/or startled, they will disappear back to the feywild. If attacked before they can flee, they will fight the party.

75 -	76 = Crumbled, overgrown with foliage set of stairs that, if climbed, would transport you somewhere else.

77 -	78 = Giant mushrooms that'll give you trip if interacted, Con save DC 16

79 -	80 = Boggle Attack. 2d4 boggles decide the party has something tasty in their packs. They aren't trying to hurt anybody but they will be taking the snacks, thank you very much

81 -	82 = Party walks into bunch of mushrooms that release spores and will grow on anything or anyone within hours/days

83 -	84 = At the edge of an empty clearing stands an elaborately carved doorway, a sign hanging from one of the posts reads ""The Ambling Arms"". Cross the threshold and one finds the clearing suddenly full of patrons seated at tables grown from gnarled wood and sipping flagons of mead ably served by your host, the dryad Thelphise. At the center of the clearing stands a mighty tree, its broad canopy providing ample protection from the elements. Nestled in the branches high above are bungalows of woven wicker. For the price of 1 whimsy Thelphise provides lodging and repast. Should you choose to rest here you find your sleep restful, dreams untroubled as you're gently rocked by a warm breeze rustling through the leaves. - Unbeknownst to the players they awake 1d10 miles away in a random direction as Calomis, an ancient treant in whoms limbs they rested, uprooted and ambled along.

85 -	86 = Portal Snake (Fey Side Quests #5)

87 -	88 = Leprechaun that will try to steal from players and run. If any harm is done to him, he'll release stolen loot.

93 -	94 = Leshen that shapeshifted into an old man with emerald eyes warns/threatens adventurers to proceed no further.

95 -	96 = Fey Bartender (Fey Side Quests #6)

97 -	98 = A large table and set of chairs is placed beneath a sprawling shady oak, setting for a large number of guests, including cakes and libations. Optional: the table is overgrown, and concealed beneath the vines are the skeletal remains of guests in finery. Additional: the table has a powerful pull to ""get the party started!"" and NEVER leave.

99 -	100 = Healing Spring with moon lilies and moonlit butterflies.

&#x200B;

**For the Fey Quests:**

1. A pack of quicklings have discovered a Dryad's garden, and have been regularly raiding it for her special blue flowers, which have an addictive, mind-altering pollen they can't get enough of. The Dryad asks for the party's help to eliminate these pests. They can be found nearby in a den, completely distracted and in various states of lucidity. Their noses are covered in blue powder. (Edit: I give the quicklings a 1d4 damage ranged attack that lowers max HP by 1. I also give them innate Spider Climb as an ability to make them even more annoying.)

&#x200B;

2. The players hear singing down the path. They come across a Dryad and her garden, and realize that her flowers have grown up and over the entrance to a tunnel they're supposed to enter. She will let them through in exchange for help (possibly idea #1) -- or she can be attacked. In the area with her is a large, tree-like golem that is covered in moss. If attacked, this golem comes to life as a Shield Guardian and protects the Dryad.

&#x200B;

3. A group of bandits/cultists/whatever from the Material Plane have set up camp. In the middle of their outpost is a large, smoldering pile of various Fey corpses, with several more tied to a wooden pylon in the center of it. For whatever reason, these cultists are trying to cull the local population of docile Fey creatures. (Note: There is flexibility here for a twist: the bandits are actually the good guys trying to protect their home from these actually evil Fey).

&#x200B;

4. The party comes across a traveling Firbolg named Burden, taking a bath in a hot spring. If the party talks to him, he explains:

""My tribe has sent me on a journey to chart areas around the world where the arcane ley lines intersect and create nodes of great power. Each node is different, however one thing that they all have in common is their propensity to create these peaceful areas where you can lay your head to rest or soak your exhaustion away.""

""Some believe that this water is an area of energy where the thoughts and emotions of the dead have gathered. Some believe they transcend time, and that this water comes from the future or that it comes from the past. If you take a sip, you will know why.""

Drinking from the source of this hot spring grants an esoteric vision of the future or past.

Burden is also happy to trade, but only magic items for magic items.

&#x200B;

5. The party comes across a shallow pool full of chalky white, smooth stones -- perhaps along a river they've been following. In the center of the pool is a small circular island of these rocks. A good Perception check will reveal the coiled body of a snake-like creature on the far side. Attacking, or being detected walking past, will awake a Rusulka. She will begin to sing (Feel free to use this mix I made). Roll Initiative, and have players make (very high) Wisdom Saving Throws. On a Fail, they are compelled to kneel in the water and listen to her words. They can make the Saving Throw again at the beginning of their turn. If (ideally when) all players succumb to her song, read the following and allow players to respond if they'd like.

""I sing a tale of bone and marrow, an evil looming in the shadow. Not of this place, but of the blight, it tore from me my heart, my light. A hundred souls have heard my hymn, a hundred souls I've sent to save him. None succeed, not even one -- but yet I sing to carry on ... the story of my dusk and dawn, until he's back within my arms.""

""In the dark is where you go, where he once went, where I can't follow. Down that tunnel, you'll ascertain an entrance to the shadow plane. From there, don't stray, he is not far. A cave like this, but more bizarre. Find my love, break him free. End our pain and suffering.""

""You have my blessing, so take my light. I hope it helps you on your fight. Darkness too I will bestow, take these needles and make them sew."" (5 bolts of disenchantment)

She then releases the players from their paralysis. There is a portal to the Shadowfell down a side tunnel, leading to an area very similar to this one. However, instead of white, round rocks, there are countless, bleached white skulls. On the island is a long spear, on which a desiccated knight is hung. There is a demon -- a Bulezau -- here. Once killed, the players can find the knight's helmet -- Helm of the Sun -- and retrieve his spear -- Spear of the Moon. They can choose to bring this back to the Rusulka, who will allow them to keep it for giving her peace.

""You have done what a hundred could not. You have returned with what I sought. My vengeance wrought, though all for naught. None the less, you gift me rest. My song ends now, my heart suppressed. Consider this my last refrain. I return at last, to the Fey Domain.

&#x200B;

6. A little tavern in the middle of the forest called The Fairy's Circle, surrounded by a thin circle of mushrooms. The entire building appears to be made out of a singular organism, and any food ordered is immediately grown and produced on the counter out of rapidly growing plant life.

The only person in the tavern is a singular Fey-- the barkeeper-- whose facial features are hard to pin down. Every time you look away they seem to change, and you're not even sure if they're human at all. Casting any kind of identification or mind-reading spell has no effect, though notably casting Speak With Plants causes the barkeeper to respond to the caster out loud whenever they attempt to talk with the living building-organism.

The barkeeper is the friendly sort, not saying all that much, and pulling their patrons' legs with Fey pranks rather than being malicious-- their favourite is asking a group if they can have their order, and then magically lifting them in the air to switch their physical order in the queue. Surprisingly, they don't charge money for their services, with tall tales of adventures and friendly conversation seeming to suffice.

Thanks for reading all the way to the end, if you have ideas, improvements or anything in between I'd appreciate it."
401,"We've all seen lists of perks/boons and lists of curses/banes. This list is for pairing those up. These can be minor or major, but the severity of the curse should be relatively on par with the strength of the perk (though they needn't necessarily be directly related to each other).

&#x200B;

1. Gain vulnerability to cold damage but resistance to fire damage
2. Gain a permanent +1 to a random ability score and -1 to a different random ability score.
3. Ignore one level of exhaustion, but every action taken makes a random sound effect (made by the DM) that is audible from 15 feet away.
4. You gain a permanent +5 speed but you must make a DC 10 constitution saving throw when rolling initiative or your speed is reduced to 0 for the first round of combat.
5. All non-magical weapons wielded by you become +3 magical weapons but break after being used 20 times (neither effect applies to improvised weapons).
6. \+2 to all charisma checks, but people you ever have performed charisma checks on strongly dislike you when you aren’t around. (Cruela DeVil) /ButtonholePhotophile)
7. \+2 to all strength checks but each time you make a strength check you lose half your total gold/coin/gems. /ButtonholePhotophile)
8. \+2 to Intelligence checks, but a -5 to perception and insight (including passive). (Nerdy trope) /ButtonholePhotophile)
9. \+2 to dexterity checks, but not being of the “chaotic or neutral good“ alignments results in automatically crit failing all roles. (Aladdin) /ButtonholePhotophile)
10. \+2 to Constitution but -4 HP per level to a minimum of level 1 HP. (Uncommon resolve) /ButtonholePhotophile)
11. \+2 to wisdom but it takes 1d4 hours to fall asleep (Note, six hours of sleep are required for a long test, which may need to be extended to accommodate). /ButtonholePhotophile)
12. You can yell so loudly it can do 1d8 force damage, however due to the constant ringing in your ears, you have become half deaf /Aquashinez)

1. The dock workers's union:
Consisting of those that work both the air and sea docks, they have come together to fight for better working conditions.

2. The league of Gentleman's Gentlemen:
A society of butlers, bodyguards, and similar types that come together to drink and talk shop.

4. The City Police:
Self evident--the police force of the city.

404,"Need some artifacts to fill a modern day occultist museum exhibit called ""The Hall of Haunted Objects"". I'm looking for objects with dark/tragic/mysterious histories and/or origins and/or are rumored/implied to have supernatural qualities/attributes.

&#x200B;

1. **Charlie:** An expertly taxidermized racehorse. He used to belong to a local taxidermy museum, but after numerous reports by the closing staff of hearing horse noises and galloping through the halls, and the unsolved incident in which the morning staff found the corpse of a would-be bulgar, seemingly trampled to death, Charlie was transferred here. Just looking at him gives you the creeps, and whenever you look away you swear can faintly hear Charlie neighing and following you out the corner of your eye with his dead, plastic ones. \[/The_OG_Anime_Mage\]
2. **The Requiem Bell:** An ancient and decrepit cast iron funeral bell, crusted with dried grave dirt and etched with eldritch runes which glow a dull green. Ghost stories say when rung, the bell produces a sound so mournful and soul-searingly haunting, none who’ve rung it once dare to ring it a second time to confirm it. There’s even a sign that reads in big, bold red letters: “**DO NOT RING!!!**”. You are unable to tell if they're joking or not. Maybe you should ring the bell and find out... \[/The_OG_Anime_Mage\]
3. **The Blood Diamond:** The history of this brilliant is as red as the stone itself, stained with the blood of it's many, many previous owners. Or than that, it's just an ordinary diamond, albeit one the size of golf ball and of a splendid shade of pigeon's blood. As you think this, you find yourself reaching for the stone even though it's in a triple-reinforced glass display case. Huh, weird. \[/The_OG_Anime_Mage\]
4. **The Fozzie's Piz-Za-Roma Characters:** Fozzie's Piz-Za-Roma was a hit pizza place al la Chuck E Cheese, with video game arcades, animatronic stage shows, kitschy prizes and of course some tasty pizza. That is until members of the staff prematurely ended a birthday party with brutal murder, the employees responsible committing suicide by the time the police arrived. This incident ultimately led to Fozzie's Piz-Za-Roma closing it's doors, never to open or host another birthday party ever again. However, rumors and urban legends say the employees were an octave of notorious serial killers and had performed an unholy ritual before themselves. So when they died, their spirits continued to live on in the bodies of the animatronic characters of Fozzie's Piz-Za-Roma, prowling the now dark and deserted rooms and hallways of the places. Some say they are looking for more victims to sate their unquenchable bloodthirst, others saying they're seeking a way of escape from their sealed and boarded-up tomb. Sadly, you'll probably never know if there was any of truth to these wild ghost stories now. All that's there are pieces of the animatronics' outer costumes on modified display stands, mostly just the head, torso and some of their respective accessories, though a few of them have the occasional extra part or two (i.e. ears, eyes, mouth bits, additional accessories, limbs etc.). The info stands say this is because all but one of the nine animatronics, ""Fozzie Flufffox"", ""Hershey Hamster"", ""Kiss Cow"", ""Pebble Pig"", ""Bumble Bear"", ""Coco Croc"", ""Rufus Rat"", and ""Boogy Bat"" were found dismantled from some prior event, with the parts littered in spread-out piles, with the ninth animatronic, ""Crystal Cat"", nowhere to be found. The stands then go on to say that was obviously the work of some stupid teenage vandals and if you have any information regarding the whereabouts of a pale blue cat animatronic with a silver hairbow, you should contact the museum at \*insert phone number here\* immediately! \[/The_OG_Anime_Mage\]
5. **Inquisitor's Barbed Crown of Truth:** An intimidating crown of night-black iron, wrought into a circlet of wickedly sharp thorns, it's origins date to the Dark Ages, where is it is believed to be one of many created and used by a particularly overzealous order of inquisitors as a primitive version of a lie-detector. Medieval fables and folklore say that if a wearer of one of these ""truth crowns"" should ever tell a lie, they shall shed a tear of fresh blood. It doesn't look very comfortable either. \[/The_OG_Anime_Mage\]
6. **Shawl of the White Widow:** A long, snow-colored scarf of fine spider silk, stitched with an intricate pattern of a spiderweb in pale silver, complete with a silver scarf pin in the shape of a stylized spider. Fashionable yet durable, this scarf was previously owned by the infamous Lyssandra Faries, better known as ""The White Widow"", a seductive, two-faced widow cougar who operated out of a twelfth-floor room of a well-renowned local hotel, responsible for confirmed murders of twenty plus young men. This scarf was her well-known murder weapon of choice, often wrapping it around her victim's neck then tightening it more until the victim suffocated. You find it unnerving that such a beautiful scarf was used for something as despicable as murder. \[/The_OG_Anime_Mage\]
7. **Carved Bone Charms:** Small bones fashioned into trinkets and jewelry. All hand made and carved with intricate designs. They were discovered in a large unsettled mound in the middle of a large tribal territory. Reports say the natives performed strange rituals on the mound where they buried these bones for an unknown purpose. The bones don't resemble and local animals and are as of yet, unidentified. \[/egoplasm\]
8. **Sooth Sayers Glass Orb**: A small glass orb about the size of a fist. It belonged to an old woman who claimed that in the hands of a skilled magician, it can be used to predict future disasters. One need only look through it and witness the event in it's entirety. The woman also advised that you never leave it uncovered with no one in the room or it would burn the building down. \[/egoplasm\]
9. **Gris Gris talisman:** A small cloth bag with a long string intended to be worn around the neck. It has written on it several verses of a song in a long forgotten language. The talisman was used to ward off bad luck and evil spirits, but only when one has the correct number of ritual objects placed within the bag. The bag is currently empty. \[/egoplasm\]
10. **Brakeman's Hand:** The skeletal remains of a human hand once belonging to a railroad brakeman. The hand is broken off in the center of the forearm and is clutched into a loose fist. Ever since the hand was added to the collection there have been late night reports of a spectral hand roaming the halls with a lantern. \[/egoplasm\]
11. **A worn, faded GameLad Cartridge:** A grey cartridge to an older handheld system called the GameLad. One of the previous owners recorded many stories and rumors from the schoolyard speaking of a haunted game cartridge that wound up in the backpacks of children. These cartridges seemed to echo popular games, like Mega Jump Sisters, Pack-Monster Battle Green, and The Legend of Hyrule. Only, as the children began to tell others at school, they began to take a much darker turn. Kids began to go missing at school, one by one. The museum goes on to say the last owner detailed the horrors of 'his game', and how it eventually began to warp their dreams, and drive them to harm themselves. The owner eventually went missing, and the cartridge was sold off in a police auction to paranormal investigators along with all the research and paperwork associated with it. \[/comedianmasta\]
12. **Creepy Pasta:** A box of old, dusty spaghettis pasta. However it is said, when cooked, that the noodles shall always fall on the plate in such a manor as to create the face of the one who will kill you. The creepy image is always of a pasta-haired smiling woman with no teeth. The death of multiple partakers of the pasta led to the recovery of the box, and the realization that the box is never empty, and always has at least a single serving inside. \[/comedianmasta\]
13. **A withered Bus Pass with a destination reading 'Hell':** Back in the before times, a horrific bus fire claimed the life of a single passenger. According to the bus driver, she was screaming that her seatbelt was stuck, and she could not escape. However, the type of bus was not outfitted with any seatbelts. When her remains were exhumed from the wreckage, it was found her partially burned purse held a few unburnt items, and a single, untouched, bus pass which listed a destination: ""Hell"". \[/comedianmasta\]
14. **A jar with a dead spider inside:** Museum records say the spider was nicknamed ""Charlotte"" and was living for several years before dying a year ago. The spider was said to spell out crude pleas for help in its webs and attempt to arrange its food into English letters. The rumor is the museum obtained the spider from the closing of a Government facility where the spider apparently used to spell out words on paper. These words were 'Help'. ""I'. 'Devon'. 'Home'. 'Please'. '*Expire*'. and '*Amercon*'. \[/comedianmasta\]
15. **Indian and the Cupboard:** A small cupboard of Two feet by one and a half feet by four inches. Made of a sturdy wood. Unknown year. One door in the front with an old, iron key and lock. An old tin Native American figurine with base, done in the Lakota Tribe style. Looks old, 1850s - 1920s. It is said the cupboard brings to life that which is closed inside of it and turns to tin, wood, or plastic living things closed inside it as well. Wherever this Cupboard goes, so too does this Native American figurine. Old records deem it the ""Indian of the Cupboard"" and museum procedures explicitly forbid the use of the Cupboard, and call out explicitly to keep the key separate from the figurine. All who have tested the Cupboard have done so in secure conditions, unrecorded, or have disappeared, listed as ""relieved of duty"". \[/comedianmasta\]
16. **Bag of Shoes:** This is a clear evidence bag full of baby shoes. They are from across decades, different styles, boys and girls. No one knows who they belong to, DNA is not a match on anyone. The shoes were found submerged in a trash bag in a river, tied to a tree on the bank with rough twine. Great lengths were taken to hide the twine from passers-by while ensuring the knots were strong. People are said to get chills around the bag. \[/comedianmasta\]
17. **Sideshow Attraction:** Lovingly called 'Bob', this is a large glass jar filled with chemicals and the taxidermy monstrosity of some sort of large fish and small monkey. Although many collectors through the years admit it's a fake and was used to swindle patrons of a traveling sideshow: many have claimed to see it breath, and a few collectors admit to hearing tapping on the glass when they are not looking. The museum procured it after the founder had ""an experience"" with the item while viewing a collector's collection. \[/comedianmasta\]
18. **Nokia Phone:** An indestructible Brick of a bygone age, this particular cellular phone has been passed around collectors due to its haunted nature. No matter the state: service or no, battery dead, charged, or removed, the phone will often receive phone calls from unlisted numbers. The calls will feature heavy, often labored, breathing, whimpers and silent sobs, or ethereal moans of pain. After years of study, tracing the origin of many of these calls has lead to cellphones of missing children, women, travelers, and more. While in the possession of the museum, a single phone call has been received and traced, and it lead to the discovery of a body of a missing woman, a decade old. While the body is still under investigation, the museum now has a policy to record, research, and trace any and all phone calls received on this device. \[/comedianmasta\]
19. **8 Pages of the Business Man:** Throughout recent history, missing persons cases, strange murders, and unexplained paranormal activity have surrounded the urban legend of the 'Business Man', a ghostly figure in a suit. What is proven, with facts, is many victims, cultists, or bystanders have reported finding or seeing strange pieces of paper, 8 1/2 by 11 inch paper, with strange drawings associated with them. As internet sleuths have investigated the connections, they have established a few common threads. There are always eight at the scene of suspected 'Business Man' activity, and the designs all appear to depict the same scenes, although in different hands and styles of the presumed victims or cultists. The museums has managed to collect 35 examples of these (4 sets and a few extras). \[/comedianmasta\]
20. **Occult Barbies:** The museum holds a rather large collection of Barbie Dolls they label as 'Occult Barbie'. All are found or recovered dolls separated into 3 groups. One group all share that the owners have damaged or removed the mouth and eyes of the doll. Their hands are almost always bound behind their backs with their legs broken or tied as well. Many examples of these dolls have burned hair or the doll themselves is burned in an attempt to destroy them. Many stories related to these involve children who grew scared of their doll or attempted to destroy their doll. One group all share dolls who have been dressed in makeshift robes which all strangely share a coloration pattern of black or grey with red lining. The dolls makeup are all eerily similar, with black diamonds around the eyes and red smiles on the face. Some examples have ""bone masks"" or ""hats"", often using mice, hamster, bird, or other small animal skulls. A few feature human baby teeth and cat/dog teeth and claws arranged as homemade accessories. A few examples have been given bone / wood / or metal weapons (or razor blades). The final group are all examples of the ""purified"". These dolls all share either being sealed in containers of (what are claimed to be) holy water. They are often 'naked' and with their hair cut off. Feature symbols or icons of various religions (a high amount being \[Christian\] in nature). Bound in rosaries or rope made of plant matter. Some have garlic cloves tied to them. Some were found in salt circles in abandoned homes, or in town parks, or in storage. \[/comedianmasta\]
21. **The Hellevision:** An old tv. Most channels are static interrupted by ghostly voices or faintly visible hainted scenes. However channel 66 on the UHF dial clearly shows screaming souls. \[/FirstChAos\]
22. **Duchess Matilda Canossa:** A brass and glass case a porcelain doll in intricate finery and glass eyes of fine craftsmanship, clarity, and depth, displayed inside, along with some accessories, with a small plaque labelled with the doll's name.  Given to a grieving parents, the doll seemed fulfilling; doting on the doll quickly becomes a full-time task, so much so that putting the doll down, sleeping, eating, drinking, and eventually breathing, becomes nearly impossible. The museum had acquired three of the five known dolls of this type, crafted between 120 and 300 years ago, but only first discovered in the estate collection of Willoughby, Duchess of Grant, by the former (and now disgraced) Heads of Collections and Research, Drs M. Castellan and G. Tulley. Without Board approval, Dr Tulley, given admitting privileges at the nearby Our Lady Saint Aire of Dymphnos Asylum, conducted a series of patient exposures to the doll. The unfortunate patients have since passed, except for one, who remains incarcerated for assaulting and murdering Dr Castellan, when he attempted to remove the doll from said patient by force. \[/MaxSizeIs\]
23. **Sabine, Laocoön, and Judgement:**  A triptych painting of a horrific massacre, the final masterpiece of the famed artist Comnena Eparchos, the patron who commisioned the work placed it beneath a case of silvered glass, after a number of family and staff members who regularly saw the painting while it was displayed in their office developed an agonising form of cancer. The cancerous victims died an agonizing death, but only after screaming and contorting their bodies in bone-breaking paroxysms that eerily match those painted on the canvas. The panels of the triptych were cryptically titled: ""Sabine, Laocoön, and Judgement"". The patron who commissioned the piece never questioned the artist's decision to name the work, nor had the artist or the patron ever explained their naming decision prior to thier deaths. Aside from the grisly coincidence, no other historical or biographical explanation can be found for the name, why the painting was commissioned, nor its choice of aesthetics or theme.  \[/MaxSizeIs\]
24. **Ghast Heart:** A putrid pale, bone-white organ in a see-through biological container, bearing a perturbing resemblance to a human heart, oozing out a gray, bloodlike substance which then evaporates immediately. No one at the museum seems to recall where or how they got this. Wait, did-did it just, try to... beat? \[/The_OG_Anime_Mage\]"
405," So, I thought it’d be funny if there was a legging store from a modern mall that was just there in a medieval fantasy qorld.

406,"Welcome friends, to the Alpha Complex. In the Paranoia RPG, you play as a Troubleshooter, a clone of minimal clearance whose job it is to find Commie Mutant Traitors and shoot them. While Friend Computer has declared it illegal to be apart of a secret society, most citizens have been corrupted by these foul influences. The real question is, what secret society are YOU apart of.

If you have an idea for a secret society, post it down below and I'll add it till I get to 100. And remember, **Be Alert, Trust No One, and Keep Your Laser Handy.**

&#x200B;

1. ***Anti-Mutants:*** *In the Alpha Complex, mutants are always a threat. This group is focused on eliminating ALL mutants, registered or not, and keeping the genetic line clean. (Mind you, most of them are probably mutants.)*
2. ***Communists:*** *Due to Anti-Communist propaganda in Friend Computer's historical records, the Computer is always worried of Communist threats. Of course, most traitors don't know what a communist is, however if the Computer hates it, they like it.*
3. ***Computer Phreaks:*** *CP are wannabe programmers, hackers and tech-freaks who wish to surf the web and create new programs. Of course, Friend Computer doesn't like this.*
4. ***Corporate Metal:*** *Corporate Metal believes in robo-supremacy. Most of its members have been augmented with cybernetics, and most believe that robots should maintain control of Alpha Complex.*
5. ***Death Leopards:*** *Death Leopards are party animals, daredevils, and wannabe rock stars hoping to leave an imprint in Alpha Complex. Whether that be for the better or worse.*
6. ***FCCC-P:*** *In Alpha Complex, all religion is illegal. That includes religions where Friend Computer is considered a god.*
7. ***Frankenstein*** ***Destroyers:*** *FD is a society dedicated to destroying ALL computers and robots in Alpha Complex. Including Friend Computer.*
8. ***Free Enterprise:*** *Free enterprises are a mixture of gangs, wanna-be corporations, and other capitalist organizations attempting to make as much money as possible in Alpha Complex.*
9. ***Humanists:*** *Humanists rebel against their robotic overlord, Friend Computer, in the hopes of returning to a Human-run society. They forget, of course, that it was a human-run society that CAUSED the ""great accident"" in the first place.*
10. ***Illuminati:*** *The Illuminati are, by their own definition, an unknown group. Who runs them? Aliens? Other Alpha Complexes? The High Programmers? No one knows. Not even those in charge.*
11. ***Mystics:*** *The Mystics are a group who focus on getting as high as possible whenever possible. Spiritualism is fairly important to the group, though only secondary to their primary purpose.*
12. ***Pro-Tec:*** *Pro-Tec are simply a bunch of nerds and scientists who want to further the lengths of their research. Their highly immoral and dangerous research.*
13. ***Psion:*** *In Alpha Complex, mutants are treated as traitors or second-class citizens. Psion believes in mutant-supremacy, and wishes to evolve Alpha Complex into its next form.*
14. ***PURGE:*** *PURGE wishes to blow up the Alpha Complex. They don't really have much planned afterword*
15. ***Romantics:*** *Romantics are obsessed with pre-Alpha Complex history. This includes everything from Star-Trek to Ancient Japanese History. Of course, due to ""the great accident"", the records are scrambled and it's hard to tell what's fact from fiction.*
16. ***Sierra Club:*** *The Sierra Club admires nature and all it's beauty. Of course, being in the Alpha Complex, most forms of nature is either banned or higher-clearance, but they wish to change that. RELEASE THE BEARS!*
17. ***Program Groups:*** *The Alpha Complex is ruled by a group of programmers called ""The Ultraviolet."" To become an ultraviolet, one must either be promoted to the rank, or find some underhanded way of becoming one. Program groups are either a group owned by an Ultraviolet, looking to keep their power, or by a upper-class citizen (Green or higher), or group of citizens, looking to find their way to Ultraviolet status.*
18. ***Cthulhu Cults:*** *Somehow, these ancient gods wormed his way in here. With secretive blood sacrifices, ancient rituals and maddening gods, they hope to bring forth the end of the world.*
19. ***Complex Laser Association:*** *Complex Laser Association are a bunch of lunatics who think the Complex has been taken over by Commies, and are amassing a massive army and arsenal to retake the Complex.* 
20. ***Workers of the World (Wooblies):*** *The Wooblies don't technically exist. They were originally IntSec agents and Troubleshooter sent to spy on the Wooblies organization, which didn't exist. As such, this organization is simply a group of other organizations who want to spy on the Wooblies.*
21. ***The Runners:*** *The Runners want to leave Alpha Complex. They do this by collecting maps, acting as couriers for other groups, and sabotaging Alpha Complex security.*
22. ***The Movement/The Foundation:*** *The Movement/The Foundation believes that the Alpha Complex is broken, but it can be fixed. The first thing they need to do, however, is replace Friend Computer with a more competent AI.*
23. ***Old Guard:*** *On occasion, a Program Group fails. The High Programmer in charge is retired, erased or otherwise demoted. While the group may be rendered useless, it's participants are still active. Some act to return their master to power, others hope to reform a new program group in their image. Regardless, these skilled players remain on the field.*
24. ***Moo:*** *Who is Moo? No one really knows. It's an Avant-guard group whose artistic endeavors typically lead to the nonsensical, and somewhat humorous, acts of rebellion. At least they seem to be having fun.*
25. ***Groupies:*** *Groupies are the fanatical fans of various stars in the Alpha Complex. While they act like a Program Group, the owner of the group typically doesn't care to become an Ultraviolet.*
26. ***Femme Fatal:*** *In the Alpha Complex, gender is irrelevant. Everyone is cloned, and sexuality is neutered through medication. Some people WANT it to matter though. This group hopes for an Alpha Complex run explicitly by women.*
27. ***Manly Men:*** *In the Alpha Complex, gender is irrelevant. Everyone is cloned, and sexuality is neutered through medication. Some people WANT it to matter though. This group hopes for an Alpha Complex run explicitly by men.*
28. ***Spy for a Service Group:*** *Most service groups are perfectly legal, and don't NEED a secret organization running around to help ensure its goals. In fact, most Service Firms are run by OTHER secret societies. However, occasionally a number of Service Firms do come together and work to create an effective monopoly for their own sectors. This is HIGHLY illegal, and HIGHLY profitable.*
29. ***Spy for an Alternate Alpha Complex:*** *Sometimes, the spy across the room isn't even from the Alpha Complex, they're from an Alternate Alpha Complex. With an Alternate Friend Computer who has alternative motives. Alternate.*
30. ***Spy for an outside organization:*** *Sometimes, spies in the Alpha Complex come from places that aren't even Alpha Complex. They aren't even Omega Complexes. They're just governments, states, or other organizations that exist outside of the Alpha Complex's walls.*
31. ***Spy for the Underplex:*** *Sometimes, spies aren't even from the Alpha Complex, but from the clones, mutants and other monstrosities underneath. Let's hope the Alpha Complex isn't stolen by bats.*
32. ***Clone Arrangers:*** *Clone Arrangers view the current cloning system as flawed, and wish to change the basic clone template for the betterment of Alpha Complex.*
33. ***B3 Sommeliers:*** *While B3 clubs are typically legal, some clubs are a bit TOO fanatical. They seek banned flavors, drink upper-clearance drinks, and host dangerous B3 parties.*
34. ***The Teela-O-MLY Fan Club:*** *Teela-O-MLY is one of the Alpha Complex's favorite citizens. Sadly, some citizens take this fandom WAY too seriously. Some clubs encourage members to fight to the death in order to rise through the ranks. Worse yet, they heavily stalk Teela and her staff.*
35. ***The Lenny-R-JRK Fan Club:*** *Lenny-R-JRK is one of the Alpha Complex's least favorite citizens. How can you admire such a vile villian? Such an unrepentant jerk? Only a traitor would admire such a reviled individual. Ironically, Lenny is far more docile than Teela, wanting only to live his life in peace. His fans rarely let this happen.*
36. ***The Assassin's Guild:*** *Some Secret Societies have realized that killing clones is a lucrative business. They've put their own petty differences aside and created a viable system of assassination contracts.*
37. ***The Kite Flyers:*** *A secret society who focuses on flying kites. Hey not all secret societies need to be complicated OK? Some people just want to fly kites in highly impractical places.*
38. ***Xeno-plex:*** *This secret society believes that aliens exist, either in or near Alpha Complex. They focus on finding new extraterrestrials, discovering alien artifacts, and posting conspiracy theories.*
39. ***The Secret Door Society / Rats in the Walls:*** *The secret door society doesn't care for restricted access zones. They build and maintain secret tunnels between (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet, and Ultraviolet) zones. For a price they might even smuggle (items, people) between these zones. If you get caught in a zone above your security clearance, they never heard of you. Anyone who speaks about their tunnels tends to have unfortunate accidents.* ***(World\_of\_Ideas)***
40. ***The Meeb*** *The Meeb is an organization of extra-complexial cloneforms who live among the IR citizens. They look like them, talk like them, dress like them, work like them, follow the rules like them, have a general economic like them, pretend to love the Computer like them. They are totally undistinguishable from them. Totally. No one knows the Meeb's agenda, motives or goals. Like not anyone. The only known is ""the device"". Few have seen it, no one remembers what it does. (****wolfa127****)*
41. ***The Stealers' Guild:*** *A group that has dedicated their lives to uphold the unbroken line of stealers, passed down from clones even before the Alpha Complex (a living complex known as the Stadium, ruled by the great Umpire). They even have a super secret sign language. Once every week cycle the Stealers meet to perform the uncomputationable rite of ""the Game"". An overly complex ritual that consist of 50 randomly chosen clones, the ancient lead pipe of the Chiroptera, several speherical objects (only one is actually needed but most breaks) and four small floor waxing bots glued to the ground. This is an act of horrendous boredom that sometimes goes on for several minutes. All other guild members must watch and shame the chosen ones while consuming warm meat of the something living (hey, the ancient scrolls are rally hard to translate!). The last part being the guilds highest priority of acquisition. Thus, the members are often tasked with kidnapping other clones for the vile rite. (****wolfa127****)*
42. ***The Cooks of Alpha Complex:*** *The Cooks wish to cook. Simple as that. However, members are constantly vying and stealing ingredients either too dangerous for normal use, or too high-clearance for THEIR use. Regardless, they create wonderful and fantastic dishes that delight the tongue, or else they get bludgeoned by several angry chefs.*
43. ***Anti-Mutants Schism: The Steves:*** *These anti-mutants despise anyone who doesn't look like Steve-I-WND. They alter their looks, change their voices, and do whatever they can to turn themselves into Steve. It's thought that the original Steve-I managed to decant multiple clones at once, allowing him to create this strange, xenophobic cult.*
44. ***Communists Schism: The Marxists:*** *These Communists believe that Communism has strayed too far from the teachings of Marx and wish to return to form. Unfortunately for them, they chose Groucho Marx as opposed to Karl.*
45. ***Computer Phreaks Schism: The Open Source Computing Club:*** *These individuals wish to steal Friend Computer's code so that they can tinker with it, and possibly repair it to a previous, less insane, edition.*
46. ***Corpore Metal Schism: The Organ Reclamation League:*** *These Secret Society members focus on transforming their meat bodies into various Cyborgs and Robots. The flesh is weak, and only metal will survive the Alpha Complex.*
47. ***Death Leopards Schism: The Goths:*** *The goths have given up on life. Having tried, and failed, to rebel against the system, they sit in corners, smoking extra-cancer cigarettes, wearing spikey black clothing. They hope to grow their nillistic cult, ruining everyone's day.*
48. ***FCCC-P Schism:*** ***The Crusaders/Inquisition of Friend Computer:*** *FCCC-P Schisms faster than most other groups (other than the Romantics or Free Enterprise). That being said, the Crusaders and Inquisition of FCCC-P are two of the most fanatical sects of the religion. They are violent, they torture, and they do so with a clean spirit.*
49. ***Frankenstein Destroyers Schism: Alpha Complex Free Militia:*** *A group of loonies who view warbots and computers as a threat to the Alpha Complex. While heavily ""pro-Alpha Complex"", they are heavily ""Anti-Robot"" and will view any bot as a potential spy. They are also HEAVILY armed.*
50. ***Free Enterprise Schism: Corpo Corp:*** *An exaggerated corporation, which surprisingly does well for itself. Individuals are expected to be calm, clean and collected, even when doing the most menial and degrading of work.*
51. ***Humanists Schism: The Free Press:*** *A newspaper rag (with both digital and physical papers) which reveal the hidden aspects of Alpha Complex. Half of it is filth, and the other half is drek, but a sliver of it is the truth.*
52. ***Illuminati Schism: The Freemasons:*** *Unlike the ultra-secretive Illuminati, the Freemasons act like an oversized frat house. Secret handshakes and favors are constantly dolled out by a group of the ""Grand Leaders"" of the group. Followed up by a stiff drink.*
53. ***Mystics Schism:*** ***The Magicians:*** *Rather than focusing on drugs, the Magicians focus on magic and mysticism. They still do a lot of their tricks while high, or induce high-based magics.*
54. ***Pro-Tech Schism: The Tuttle-B Repair Clique:*** *In the Alpha Complex, jobs are designated for certain clearances. Some higher-clearance individuals aren't permitted to do lower-clearance work, not without upsetting the powers that be. As such, some higher-clearance individuals have banned together to avoid the needless bureaucracy and fix broken items all across Alpha Complex.*
55. ***Psion Schism: Mutants for a Better Tomorrow/Brotherhood of Mutants:*** *A pair of  mutant groups whom violently oppose each other. The MFABT believe that mutants should use their mutations to help the weak and enhance society. The BOM view non-mutants as a waste, and wish to use their abilities for their own self interests. Both wear vibrant, colorful spandex.*
56. ***PURGE Schism: The Revolutionary Chamber and JUSTICE:*** *A group of stanch traditionalists who ensure the purity of the PURGE movement. Those that fail, must face the JUSTICE enforcers.*
57. ***Romantics Schism: Specific:*** *Romantics have so many schisms, it's hard to choose just one. Typically, it's focused on some bit of pre-Alpha Complex history. Roll on the chart and choose one. (1. Television Show 2. Movie, 3. Specific Subculture 4. Country 5. Sport 6. Music 7. Historical culture 8. Internet Subculture 9. Specific Item 10. Specific Book)*
58. ***Sierra Club Schism: Eco-Terrorists:*** *Individuals who push back against the constant pollution of Friend Computer. They blow up and destroy anything that threatens to harm mother nature.*
59. ***Card Collectors:*** *There are so many security cards for various clearances, a whole underground trading community built up over decommissioned, and even active key cards. Collectors know that the higher the clearance level, the rarer the card and more valuable. And yet, even the lower level cards have value to the right collector, and some believe the cards themselves have secret codes that can be decoded if you just collect enough of them.* ***(hcaneandrew)***
60. ***The Scrubby Supremacy:*** *A small AI has overtaken some scrubbots in the Alpha Complex, and they've been lead to believe that they are more intelligent than Friend Computer. Worse yet, some traitors believe them. Of course, they're still a scrubbot, and believe everything should be CLEAN.*
61. ***The Betty Crocker Conspiracy:*** *Centuries ago, an Alien Queen crash landed on Earth. In her panic, she married the owner of a popular food brand, which soon blossomed due to her genius. Now, having caused the end of the world, she wishes to transform the Alpha Complex into a replica of her homeworld: Alternia.*
62. ***The Cosmic Matchmaker:*** *A strange group, known only as the Masters, have an obsession with love stories and secrets. unfortunately, the Alpha Complex is nearly DEVOID of love stories. These matchmakers hope to spread the gospel of romance and ensure love is in the air!*
63. ***Sierra Club schism: Return to Monke.*** *Found in hidden rainforests of plastic plants, these clubbers spend their time hiding, attempting to swing from rafters, and grooming each other. Mostly harmless, but very good spies.* ***(lsenjov)***
64. ***FCCCP schism: Return to Monk***\*. Dressed in brown robes, they make pilgrimages to holy sites while self flagellating. Willing to flagellate others to spread their beliefs.\* ***(lsenjov)***
65. ***Romantics schism: Return to Monet.*** *Reject modern art, return to pre-whoopsie. Buy/sell classics, forge classics, publicly protest bad art, replace bad art with pre-whoopsie art, assassinate artists, firebomb modern art galleries.* ***(lsenjov)***
66. ***PURGE cell: The Smilers.*** *PURGE are not known for having particularly stable members, but one cell snapped during the happiness detection misconfiguration incident of 211. In order to survive, members surgically modified themselves to have (often literal) ear-to-ear grins. While extremely off-putting to the average clone, they easily fool robotic detection systems, especially models which continue to link perceived happiness to threat level.* ***(lsenjov)***
67. ***Psion schism: The Hive.*** *During the banana nut muffin incident, R&D created a clone-queen hybrid to fight carbs with ants. While the battle was a success, the queen was sequestered away. Rumours of pretender queens fighting for control of cafeterias may be the only thing keeping the ant tide from overwhelming the sector.****(lsenjov)***
68. ***Anti-Phreaks:*** *Follow all proper security precautions to avoid getting hacked by Computer Phreaks. It just so happens that some of these precautions also happen to interfere with complex productivity and might, in some cases, be outright illegal (good cryptography with no backdoors, anonymous messaging systems, anti-malware programs that root out viruses installed by Internal Security, etc.).* ***(TariqAli)***
69. ***Super Happy Loyal Citizens (The Bugs):*** *While at first glance, the Super Happy Loyal Citizens seem to just a bunch of citizens trying way too hard to impress the Computer and IntSec by being cheerful and loyal to the point of absurdity, in reality they are a race of human sized insects who are impersonating humans as part of a plot to take over the Complex for their massive insect queen. Anyone who joins the society is killed, with the bugs using their hollowed out body as a disguise and tampering with the MemoMax system to clone the bug wearing the disguise rather than the actual citizen (though in Zap games, this might be more them wearing cheap disguises made to look like whoever they’re impersonating). While the Bugs are far from good at impersonating humans, their absurdly loyal act is enough to convince the Computer to ignore most accusations of not being human, and many low clearance citizens are too drugged out or ignorant to notice anything anyway.* ***(NickCasey)***
70. ***Friends Across The Stars***\*:  *The Friends Across The Stars not only believe in aliens, but claim to come into contact with them on a regular basis. They have one or more aliens hidden away somewhere in the Complex, and do missions to please it, no questions asked. They hope to one day convince the entire Complex to accept their intergalactic brethren, so that we may work together towards a brighter future.*\****(NickCasey)***
71. ***Alien Hunters*** *The Alien Hunters are the opposite of the Friends. While the Friends want to befriend aliens no matter what, the Hunters want to blow them into space dust, no matter what. Unfortunately, their idea of what aliens are like mostly comes from Old Reckoning comics and movies, particularly the idea that aliens impersonate ordinary people as part of their plans to conquer the Earth. They will not hesitate to blast anyone they think is an alien, and they’re quick to jump to conclusions or see minor issues as definitive proof.* ***(NickCasey)***
72. ***Mystics schism: The Clears.*** *While mystics generally are about filling themselves with more drugs, The Clears concentrate on removing all drugs from their system. AlKale and BananaLyke smoothies, electro-cleansing, hormone blocker blockers, drug-free food, and homeopathic cleansers are just part of their wide array of services for clones looking to ""go clear""****(lsenjov)***
73. ***Survivors for Preserving Alpha Complex to Eternity! (SPACE!):*** *Alpha Complex survived a catastrophic event. Something so terrible, that only Alpha Complex has survived. The outside is uninhabitable and Alpha Complex's shell is the only thing that protects everything. The problem is that the shell is weakening, even worse the destruction, sabotage and wasteful behavior shown by the Troubleshooters is creating cracks in the shell. Alpha Complex must be saved! The destruction must stop!* ***(Shai)***
74. ***Computer Phreaks Schism:***  ***The Alpha Gamers:*** *The gamers are a group of nerds and geeks obsessed with computer gaming. Unfortunately, due to the extreme work schedules at Alpha Complex, only the highest-clearance citizens typically have access to quality (or at least moderately decent) games. This secret society wishes to change this. They code and create new video-games, gamify existing work schedules, and attempt to skimp work in order to play their latest MMORPG.*
75. ***Fantasy Troubleshooters Minor League:*** *The Fantasy Troubleshooter's League is a pastime typically limited to Violets and Infrareds. Occasionally, however, a Violet (or some H&D Reporter) will host a ""minor league"" for individuals of lower ranks. This is typically considered in poor taste, though is highly lucrative due to the constant betting. Rumors that some people attempt to ""Fix"" these games are lies. Profitable profitable lies.*
76. ***The Alpha Complex Mystery Hunting Society:*** *The Alpha Complex is old. Ancient even. And yet, most Citizens hardly know anything about it. Why is it here, how long has it existed, when will it stop being 214. The ACMHS looks to find out more information about the Alpha Complex. Unfortunately the Secret Society is fairly contaminated via pseudosciences, and is fairly eager to investigate Ghosts, Cryptids, and other supernatural creatures and events.*
77. ***Alpha Complex Fight Club:*** *After Friend Computer made Martial Arts illegal, there was a spur of illegal fight clubs, tournaments, and other bloody gladiatorial tournaments. Typically, they're sponsored by some enigmatic Violet or Ultraviolet. The ""league"" has several sub-sponsors, typically through other secret societies.*
78. ***Anti-Mutants Schism: The Vigil:*** *Mostly made up of PTSD inflicted IntSec and Armed Forces members, the vigil acts to protect Alpha Complex from the evildoers who wish to destroy Alpha Complex. Unfortunately, their ""good intentions"" are typically clouded in bouts of conspiracy theories and paranoia.*
79. ***Communists Schism: Meowists:*** *Completely ignorant of China's history, Chinese Culture, or Communist China, these Communists have become convinced that Maoist doctrine is actually Meowist. These Cat-obsessed Communists believe it's the ""fat cats"" fault that the world has gone down the drain. As such, they play Cat and Mouse with FC and the other Secret Societies. They're the real Cat's Meow. {ADD ADITIONAL CAT PUN HERE}.*
80. ***Computer Phreaks Schism: The Cyber-Punks:*** *These Anarchists' wish to ""overthrow the system"" and ""bring back the static-colored skies"". It's rumored that they have found a few Old Reckoning Tapes which focus on Cyberpunk-related media, and have tried to implement it into their own ideals. Any mentions of fifth editions is met by death.*
81. ***Corpore Metal Schism: Mind Melders:*** *These insane citizens wish to Combine their own consciousness with that of a robots. At best, they end up electrocuting themselves. At worst, they succeed and accidently create a potent, and insane, AI.*
82. ***Death Leopards Schism: The Rockers' Collective:*** *A collection of musicians and groupies who wish to turn Alpha Complex into one big party. The wilder the party, the better it is.*
83. ***FCCC-P Schism: The Chessmaster's Cult:*** *Controlled by an eccentric Ultraviolet, this schism of the FCCC-P seems obsessed with chess and other board games. The Bishops ensure religious doctrine, the Rooks protect the fortress, the Queen acts as the enforcer, and the knights move in odd angles.*
84. ***Frankenstein Destroyers Schism: The Agents of Darkness:*** *Tired of the ""All Watching"" eyes of the Computer, these Frankenstein Destroyers are obsessed with eliminating any lights or camera that could shine light on their activities. Masters of working in the dark, they hope to bring forth an age of darkness.*
85. ***Free Enterprise Schism: The Mob/ Yak-U-ZAA's/ The Tri/ The Plutocrats/ The Gangsta Rappers:*** *Sometimes a Free Enterprise group gets ahold of a treasure trove of Old Reckoning Relics. Rather than selling it, they occasionally get corrupted by it, especially if it involves Old Reckoning Organized Crime.*
86. ***Humanists Schism: The Old Gods:*** *This group is obsessed with attaining godhood. Using whatever methods they can, they attempt to become all-powerful, all-beautiful rulers of the Alpha Complex.*
87. ***Illuminati Schism: The Bohemian Society:*** *A lot more mundane than most other plots, this secret society of elites use their powers to shape Alpha Complex and ensure order is maintained. Lower-ranked members typically act as servants to their overlords.*
88. ***Mystics Schism: The Fatties:*** *These citizens have become obsessed with forcing their waste bands to the utter limit. Using experimental drugs and mutations, they glut themselves on whatever food they can, to become as big as they can.*
89. ***Pro-Tech Schism: The Mad Scientists' Guild:*** *Sometimes, a pro-tech group gains access to higher-ranked citizens. All of whom wish to create and test insane projects or experiments. One enough have formed to create a conspiracy, the mad scientists quickly take over. Lower-ranked members are typically relegated as ""minions"" or ""egors"", while upper-ranked ""Henchmen"" work to ensure the Guild's plan.*
90. ***Psion Schism: Nurgle's Rot:*** *A group of Psion members who wish to corrupt the Alpha Complex as much as possible. Physical mutations are just as important as mental or social ones. Together, they will claim the Complex for the mutants!*
91. ***PURGE Schism: The Compromise:*** *Annoyed with Purge's violent tactics, this schism aims to destroy their enemies bureaucratically. As the lines get longer, food reserves get smaller, and blackouts more common, the enemies of Alpha Complex grow.*
92. ***Romantics Schism: The Mascot Mandate:*** *A strange collection of masked individuals obsessed with their alternate personas, called mascotonas. The Secret Society is heavily infiltrated by Pro-Tech and Sierra Club members, who introduce robot and animal-based personas.*
93. ***Sierra Club Schism: The Ethical Protectors of Animals in Alpha Complex (EPAAC):*** *Some Sierra Club members are obsessed with animals. Beetles, rats, the occasional sewer gator. These freaks find it utterly important to protect the Alpha Complex, and all the creatures within it.*
94. ***Funny Games:*** *This group of intelligent, eccentric, yet bored, citizens have gone about and decided to create deadly, but entertaining, games. Russian Roulette and Battle Royals are the weakest, as they employ SAW-style traps to ensure a fun time for all! All recorded for fun-little snuff tapes.*
95. ***The Hobo Code:*** *Tired of the humdrum life of the Alpha Complex, these individuals have forgone their jobs, their homes and their careers. These citizens live and communicate by the Hobo Code. They still have their clearances, but not for long if they can't scam a way around their work.*
96. ***The Tupperware Club:*** *Did you ever want to make bank? Are you tired of those lowly crates, rusted containers, or other inferior products? Welcome to the Tupperware Club! Here, you'll be able to find and sell, all things tupperware! All you need to do is sell your product, and initiate at least two new citizens (who will report to you). This isn't a Pyramid Scheme, it's a Tupperware Club!*
97. ***The Politiclones:*** *Power comes through popularity - pander to the masses and they will bail you out. But if you disappoint them, they will not hesitate to put a bullet through your back. We can help you gain popularity - if you help us gain popularity. Scratch our back, and we’ll scratch your back.* ***(TariqAli)***
98. ***Mystics schism: The Cult of Dionysis:*** *A club dedicated to the creation, and tasting, of wines (as well as other liquors, and spirits). They are also rumored to make fairly good cheese. There are a fair number of upper-clearance individuals (or ""retired"" ones) who frequent this society.*
99. ***The Uglies:*** *Tired of ""traditional beauty, these individuals work to make themselves as ugly as humanly possible. Whether it be through a lack of hygiene, an unnatural physique, or a lack of fashion, they work to make the world an uglier place.*
100. ***The Fashion Police:*** *Obsessed with style and grace, these individuals attempt to enforce a code for beauty and high fashion in the Alpha Complex. Resistance is futile!*
101. ***The Artificer's Guild:*** *Tired of the shoddily -made items of PLC, these individuals craft magnificent structures, foods, and items for all to marvel at. Unfortunately, while these items are aesthetically pleasing, they don't always follow the laws of nature, and often crumble apart due to a ""lack"" of good materials.*

Heya all! I’m working on an NPC generator for a game of WarRogue Trader I’m planning, although it should be  agnostic.

The goal is to provide a quick prompt that is both detailed enough to easily spark the GM’s imagination and also vague enough to leave them enough room for improvisation. Part of this prompt is what I call the **Face**.

**Face:** What the other are noticing when encoutering this NPC. It is not limited to visual, as it includes a peculiar look, a specific way of dressing, but also how they speak or move, and what do they “feel like” overall. This appearance should be striking enough so that this character will be remembered with it alone.

*For example: “They are pretty.” is not a good enough entry, as it is not that striking and doesn’t spark any ideas easily, while “They are impossibly pretty, so much so that it is nearly uncanny, otherworldy maybe?” is more evocative and can spark a few hooks (Maybe they are actually from another world, or they are using tech/magic to improve their look, meaning that maybe they do have access to magic, in some way, etc…)*

So far, I found 73 entries, and I’m looking to reach 100, but I’m struggling to find 27 more meaningful entries. Can I request from some help?

98. They are not born with their face, it was reconstructed or modified. Hard to say if it's an enhancement or a way to hide something.

100. They are emotionally stunted. They never express anything except a stoic facade that never fades, they are unable to express pain, and it makes them unwillingly cold and distant to others.

I´´ m ´ looking to make a D100 list about possible members of a secret aristocratic society.

1. Mist - A reserved and quiet member, he usually goes out at night, leaving a trail of mist in his wake.
2. The missionary - The one in charge of finding people in need and convincing them to work for this organization
3. The Pale - An outgoing woman who loves to spy on people hidden in the snow
4. The Scavenger - A servant who is part of the organization, but is not respected by it, often engages in dirty work and looting.
5. Laniakea - An elder man, obsessed with the stars and outer space, drifting his life towards it and firmly believing that the end of the world is near.
6. Clepsydra - He/she that is in charge of punctuality of events, keeping everything on a tight schedule. Wears a mask derived from thin cogs, fitted together into a pair of spectacles and half-mask that stretches down over their cheeks. oddly, the earrings they wear seem to always be swaying back in forth, like the pendulum of a clock. [**jhaosmire**](
7. Duchess - Clad in a mask pearl white, with gilding all around, she is presumed to be the lead financier of the society, though nobody has every seen her touch a coin or write a check. [**jhaosmire**](
8. Baker - A chef coveted for his confectionary concoctions, the baker beguiles the body of the society with buns and breads. Are his sweetmeats shrouding a mystery, swaying the sentiments of society members through succulent secrets? [**jhaosmire**](
9. Brotherhood - Of many faces, he that wears the mask of the Brotherhood represents the trades of the nearby community. A guild leader with unprecedented influence, the Brotherhood is not always the same man, nor even always a man, but seems to always speak with the same voice... [**jhaosmire**](
10. Shipwright - Donning a mask that compliments their trifold hat, the Shipwright brings news from the docks, of what has come, has gone, and will soon be arriving. The society prospers with this knowledge, giving those in it's troupes an advantage over those beyond its borders. [**jhaosmire**](
11. The Guardsman - Wears a shield shaped iron mask and is head of Security for the society’s gatherings and has the general command of the army. [**Dear-Macaron-471**](
12. The handsome gambit- with a gold and ivory mask depicting a strong-boned and gleeful face, this fellow acts as a middleman and talent scout. Known for allways having some work for those who need coin, but the work also involves a *Certain Risk* [**DynaDynasty**](
13. Lamplighter - Wearing a deep red coat and a brass mask, the unassuming Lamplighter weaves about the edges of the Society's gatherings, keeping the lights burning throughout the night. The task isn't a glamorous one, but it is well-respected, and as the first to arrive and last to leave, Lamplighter hears a great deal. [**Holy\_Hand\_Grenadier**](
14. Jack - The eclectic and capable Jack is masked by the face of a grinning child. Whenever a member of the Society expresses the slightest want or discontent, Jack seems to somehow arrive, peddling the perfect skills for the situation. Oh, there's no cost, of course, not to you! It's just a favor, although I'd certainly be grateful if you would think of your friend Jack sometime. When you win that bet on the horses, mayhap, and didn't I hear that you had a son? [**Holy\_Hand\_Grenadier**](
15. Scribe - In ancient, stained finery, the Scribe keeps largely alone even at the largest gatherings. Never out of hand, let alone sight: a bulging book, stuffed with blank pages well beyond what the binding ought to hold. The Scribe stops writing in it only to turn a page, and as the ink runs out, pages are marked in dyes, food, earth, and anything else that will permit writing. The Scribe's mask is composed of parchment with two slits in it, through which are visible smell black eyes. [**Holy\_Hand\_Grenadier**](
16. Crow - a talented duelist who rarely speaks, and his sentences are always short. His mask looks *exactly* like the mask of the mysterious assassin who is infamous for hunting corrupt elites. He's probably wearing that mask for intimidation, and the recent disappearances of the Society's members must surely be coincidental... [**VIixIXine**](
17. Judgement. Donning a blank white mask with no eyes under a black hood. Takes great solace in the anonymity that accompanies his rank, as he is quite the coward underneath. Believes themselves above all blame, unable to comprehend the possibility of being wrong about something. [**Shmegdar**](
18. Cavalier. Wears a mask of a chiseled, statuesque face, and notably, no other clothing beyond the bare minimum for modesty. He is an incredibly tall and muscular man with an equally statuesque body. His identity isn’t much of a question, but nobody would bother him about it even if they wanted to. Plus, they’d rather keep believing the stand-up guy they know isn’t the same as some conspirator. [**Shmegdar**](
19. Omission. Wears a completely flat mask that reflects like a mirror. Never talks. Nobody’s sure what they do but they seem feared. [**Shmegdar**](
20. Seer. Wears a stained-glass mask. You can technically see through the mask, but only a glimpse at a time depending on the angle; you’d struggle to piece together a face. Acts as an advisor and diviner. [**Shmegdar**](
21. Absolution - does not judge, but carries out judgement. Mask is a gray, featureless oval. [**scattercloud**](
22. Joydance - wears the mask of a grinning cherub. Always has a song, dance, or trick. Responsible for preparing refreshments. [**scattercloud**](
23. Not - wears a translucent, veiled shroud through which their watchful eyes can be just barely be seen. They are always present, but have no apparent function. [**scattercloud**](
24. Rabbit - the mask of a white hare and a finely tailed suit. Carries a polished mahogany cane with a polished golden knob. Always happy to introduce strangers to one another. [**scattercloud**](
25. Clemency - a rosy cheeked doll's mask. She offers encouragement and secrets. [**scattercloud**](
26. Falchion - a cruel mask of iron with thin slits for eyes and a metal grating covering the mouth. His namesake is always strapped at the hip. He is responsible for restraining those who might get a little too aggressive in their cups. [**scattercloud**](
27. Desmond - a mask that is the perfect likeness of his own face. A charming and open man who nevertheless gives off an uneasy air that inspires the others to keep up their guard. [**scattercloud**](
28. Thespian - Wearing a mask seemingly carved of marble, it depicts on one half a laughing face, and on the other a distressed one, split in half. The Thespian acts as the society’s resident actor, staging a production once every few months, where they and other masked members they’ve chosen star in a play which supposedly foretells the fate of each member. To be chosen as a member of their play is a great honor, and may reveal truths unforeseen. [**VVitchDoggo**](
29. Demon - The Demon’s mask is made of volcanic shale and ebony wood, depicting a monstrous demon with horns and fangs to match. The Demon acts as the Society’s premier expert demonologist. They often conduct public rituals to summon, speak with, and bind various smaller, and even greater demons. Although this possesses a certain degree of danger, the Demon has so far been able to keep these creatures contained and useful. [**VVitchDoggo**](
30. Knave - Composed of dozens of overlapping blades and razors, the Knave’s mask betrays their ruthless and cutthroat nature. The Knave is the Society’s enforcer and spymaster. They keep tabs on its members, using their extensive amount of contacts to ensure that they stay in line and don’t reveal the Society to others. Those that betray the Society or step out of line are made an example of. The humiliation can be as tame as a lashing at court or a momentary slashing in profits for a business, all the way to the destruction of all owned assets and extensive torture. The Knave never kills their targets, but the resulting experience is almost always enough to keep the target quiet and subservient. [**VVitchDoggo**](
31. Weaver: she wears a mask woven from multicolored yarn and works at a gigantic loon. She seems good at spotting the threads that tie different, seemingly unrelated, things together. She often wears a robe embroidered with spiders of silver thread. [**FirstChAoS**](

414,"**EDIT -** I want to clarify this for a **modern** **non-fantasy** setting, like most DC/Marvel comics.

I'm prepping for a future campaign for street-level vigilantes, and I'd like to have a table of possible life events (i.e. backstory prompts) to roll on to inspire players to make their background and set the right tone. I'm using characters like Rorschach (from Watchmen), Batman, Punisher, and Daredevil as sources of inspiration, thus dark heroes in a modern urban setting.

I'd love it if all events were made up by a neutral or positive premise and a second eventual traumatic consequence.

These are the first five! Thanks y'all!

1. *My mother used to sing to me to sleep at night.* | Until I was brought away to the orphanage by the social services. I've never seen her since.
2. *Finally, my parents agreed to take me to my favorite place in the world!* | Things went south when we met that robber. I cried due to that passing for many years to come.
3. *I was bullied by a classmate all semester.* | When my bullied died in an accident before me, I didn't save him. I felt relieved.
4. *I was involved in an accident with chemical compounds.* | When I woke up, things weren't as they used to be anymore.
5. *I used to practice that discipline at a competitive level. I went to nationals that year. |* I might've won if only I didn't suffer that injury the day before the finals. I didn't even show up, for shame.
6. \- *I had an unusual but loving childhood as \[part of a circus troupe\].* | It all came crashing down when my whole family was killed in the crossfire of someone else's debt.
7. \- *Growing up with my family was tough, but my sibling and I had each other.* | My whole world changed when one of my parents was sent to prison.
8. \- *I was trained to follow in my family member's footsteps.* | Then they sacrificed themselves for me.
9. \- *I grew up privileged by my family's criminal lifestyle.* | A shakeup in the underworld left me with nothing.
10. \- *I used to love dogs*. | Then we moved into the city, and the dogs there ate my dog and killed my little brothers, while the whole gang laughed. They will not be laughing much longer...
11. \- *I grew up in a loving home with parents that cared for my siblings and me.* / Then, one day, I heard my parents were in trouble financially. Being the oldest child, it only made sense for me to go out and make a fortune to help support them.
12. \- *My house had an ancient masonry fireplace in the living room. I used to spend time staring at the flames during winter.* / Then the mansion burned down, and I was the only survivor. I keep telling myself I wasn't responsible for it.
13. \- *I used to look up the cops. I even dreamed of becoming one, one day.* | That dream fell away when they arrested someone close to me and pinned a false crime they didn't do.
14. *I used to believe magic didn't exist until I saw that happening in front of me.* | The long-lasting effects of that spell affect me to this day. I was changed forever.
15.  *I worked hard on my honest day-to-day job and was the best at it. I didn't make a lot of money, but we were happy.* | I snapped when I lost the job and saw how much richer dishonest people were.
16. *One time, a nurse found and treated me when I was hurt. We got to know each other and got close.* | They couldn't stand my self-destructive behavior and pushed me to do something about it.
17. \-  *I was fighting for our prideful country and counted the days to my leave. All I wanted was a peaceful life.* | But I learned that the local trash killed my friend, while I was away. Now they are about to discover what it means to go to war.
18. \- *I used to be a cop. I thought I could make a difference by playing by the rules.* | I was shown otherwise when I was framed for a crime I didn't commit by the institution I sought to uphold.
19. \-  *It was supposed to be my coming out party. I called all my friends, and everyone did show up!* | Then these masked people showed up as well and shot everybody. I was mistakenly recorded as one of the casualties. I will find those men.
20. \- *I was a rising star, about to graduate top of my class.* | I was drummed out in disgrace when that bastard framed me."
415,"The idea for this originally came out of me needing some interesting characters to appear at a fancy gala discussing philosophy. Lets see if we can fill out this party together!

1. A purple draconic humanoid, that smokes from fancy pipes despite no longer needing to breathe.
2. An incredibly short gnome who has an arcane prosthetic eye, and a few porcelain fingers.
3. An older woman with frizzy hair and a sailor's coat overtop several dozen wallets of imported cigars.
4. A necromantically preserved skull in an iridescent resin, carried around by a wiry young boy who always appears nervous.
5. A stout military-man who still bears each and every pin on his dusty uniform proudly, constantly rattling his saber at those he disagrees with.
6. A flamboyant dramatist who claims to avoid disagreements and drama, but is always passive aggressively correcting and fact-checking the work of historians in a snide, sassy way.
7. A young serving girl who dabbled with alchemy once, and accidentally discovered a solution for nearly halting aging. She's currently selling it to mortuaries and morgues as an embalming fluid.
8. A serious old man that knots his beard with ties of yarn that represent ideas he's had. He doesn't remember what they all mean though.
9. An androgynous knight-poet of a far off land, that recites haiku's both when spited and appeased.
10. A dock worker who inherited  several life changing inheritances' all at once due to several uncles keeling over. Appeals to the common man.
11. An alchemist and confectioner, who secretly (or not so secretly), runs a business that hides poisons and potions in various candies.
12. A giant woman who has lost her voice, but carries a raven with her she is telepathically bound to, that speaks in her stead."
416,"As the title says, let's make 100 or so monstrous NPCs the party can interact with. 

1. **Bubba.** A lonely ogre that lives outside of (insert small town). Childish and dimwitted, Bubba lacks the vicious and brutal personality of other ogres, though he has a tendency to fly into severe temper tantrums similar to a toddler. Desperate for companionship, he has attempted make friends with some of the townsfolk, but he is often driven off after he inevitably breaks something.
2. **Trog.** An ordinary troglodyte who gained superhuman intelligence after acquiring a *headband of intellect*. Following his ""enlightenment"", Trog immediately left his tribe a has begun exploring the wider world. Curious and inquisitive, Trog is driven by his insatiable wanderlust and desire to learn.
3. **Ted.** Formerly known as ""Te'zed the Eternal"", Ted is an ancient lich who is TIRED. He's tired of watching the world pass him by, tired of all the adventurer's coming to try and kill him, tired of just existing. Ted wants to move on, but unfortunately for him, he's forgotten where he stored his phylactery.  He's now out scouring the world in the guise of old wizard, looking for any clues that might lead him to his lost phylactery.
4. **Frezz.** A hobgoblin mercenary. Exiled after his reckless tactics cost his entire platoon their lives, Frezz now wanders the world, drowning his sorrows in cheap booze. He charges into battle with a suicidal bravery, hoping to redeem himself with an honorable death in battle.
5. **Rufus.** A (formerly) human alchemist who was transformed into a vampire against his will and is now attempting to find some way to regain his mortality. Originally limiting his feedings to animals and the occasional criminal, he has since developed an alchemical substitute for blood he uses instead."
417,"D100 organically created Magic items

I love it when magic items develop naturally, through use or occasion rather than specifically being enchanted with a Permanence spell. I call it Heritage Magic.

With that being said, let’s build d100 unintentionally enchanted magic items and how they came to be!

1. The party Mage casts the Light cantrip on the Paladin’s shield every time the group went into somewhere dark. The Paladin would say “Light me up,” and the Mage lit up the shield. One day, the Paladin said “Light me up” and the shield did! Before the Mage could cast the cantrip. The group went crazy with excitement. The cantrip says it sheds bright light in a 20 foot radius and dim light for another 20 feet. The shield only casts bright light for 10 feet and dim light for 10 feet, but that could eventually get to full strength if the Mage continues to ‘*charge*’ it with the cantrip, or possibly even if the Paladin just keeps doing it themself.

**Shield of Light**  
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
Once per day, as a Bonus Action, you can speak the command phrase “Light me up” to make this shield shed bright light in a 10 foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

…

2. The party Rogue loves throwing her dagger. The Paladin is a big fan of using Bless. When blessed, the Rogue’s dagger gets the added 1d4 to hit. With repeated use, the dagger hits so often that it became enchanted with the magical blessing.

**Blessed Dagger of Rogues’ Accuracy**  
*Weapon (dagger), rare (requires attunement by a Thief or Bard)*

3. The party Barbarian was the stereotypical tank, dealing massive amounts of damage with her maul, but always taking massive amounts of damage in return. At Level 17, the Druid got Power Word Heal and had to use it on the Barbarian who had already failed their save against a Red Dragon’s breath once and was about to get hit with it again. Between the dragon’s fire and the Druid’s spell, the maul became infused with a healing ability.

**Maul of Regeneration**  
*Weapon (maul), legendary (requires attunement)*  
Once per day, when the wielder of this weapon falls to 0 hp, they instantly regain all their hit points. If the wielder is charmed, frightened, paralyzed, or stunned, the condition ends. If the wielder is prone, it can use its reaction to stand up. This magic has no effect on undead or constructs.

4. The party Bard wore the same bright red cloak for years. It was their signature item (*entertainer background*). They also used the Polymorph spell excessively to become a Rat for spying. So much so, that the Cloak began to absorb that magic.

**Cloak of the Rat**  
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  
Once a day when the wearer raises the hood of this cloak they may use their Action to Polymorph into a Rat (MM pg 335) for up to one hour (as per all the Polymorph spell rules, PHB pg 266).

…

5. The Half-Orc Ranger heard the Paladin shout “Thunderous Smite”, when she attacked, and it did extra damage, so he started doing it too, even though it’s not a Ranger spell. Whether through a silly Fey casting or a wild magic surge or a divine act by a benevolent deity, somehow, eventually the Ranger’s scimitar took on the ability to Thunderous Smite when it hit. The group went wild when this actually worked for him.

**Scimitar of Thunder**  
*Weapon (scimitar), legendary (requires attunement by a Half-Orc or Ranger)*  
Once per day, on a successful Melee Attack Roll, the wielder of this scimitar may use their Bonus Action to shout “Thunderous Smite”. The weapon rings with thunder that is audible within 300 feet of you, and the attack deals an extra 2d6 thunder damage to the target. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you and knocked prone."

They live in the walls like borrowers, occasionally steal mundane objects like pencils or car keys, and can sometimes be found skiing and ice fishing in the freezer.

419,"Bonus points if you can make them heavily steampunk or heavily arcane focused. For a town of gnome/dwarf/halfling/goblin artificers in a city at the center of an ocean that has been turned to stone. They can be combat oriented, things that would help around town, or just general nonsense.

No need to provide stats for the device, I just provided them below for a few for fun.

1. Goggles of Detailing - A set of goggles with roughly 37 lenses that will slide into place in front of one's eyes to allow extreme magnification.  
(Investigation or Perception checks based on sight can be performed using a bonus action)

2. Pocket cannon - A cannon that fits into your pocket! Fires full size cannon balls...  
You can use an action to light the fuse on this adorable little cannon. You can then make a ranged attack at a creature that you can see within range (60ft). After firing, you must make a STR saving throw DC15, or be knocked prone.

3. A floating elevator platform. The arcane side is a round platform of glass that floats in the air. The steampunk side is shaped like a nut, that then raises and lowers by rotating up and down a set of spiral-cut grooves along the central beam.

4. Streetlights with little gemstones that will absorb any Light spells cast within their vicinity. The gemstone stays lit until a creature uses its action to tap it 3 times.

5. Bracer of Holding - Tattered cloth wraps that go along the forearm. A little dirty, and pieces seem to hang free no matter how much you tuck them back underneath the other layers.  
When an attack roll misses you by 3 or more, you can use your reaction to animate these cloth-like bracers. The attacker must make a STR Check (DC15) or become grappled until the end of your next turn. Another creature can use their action to free the grappled creature. This effect can be used twice per day."
420,"So I'm doing a bit of world building for an upcoming campaign. In one of the major cities there's a large neighborhood full of witches and occult practitioners and I want to figure out some things that one may find there. Below are just a few things I came up with.

1. Brooms that run on magic power cells

2. Speakeasys that serve drinks that give off mild hallucinations to liven up the room

3. Tattoo parlors that do both regular and magic tattoos for luck/curses

4. A store selling ""magic"" stuff from the mundane world like Halloween witch costumes, ""Zoltar Speaks"", Ouija boards, and so on. None of it actually works, but witches find it all hilarious and kitschy. ( )"
421,"I'm currently making a homebrew adventure that involves an evil noble who received an ancestral book of curses given in a deal with an archdevil. He uses these curses to humiliate those he dislikes, make a spectacle of his power, and keep the peasantry in line out of fear. So these are meant to be nonlethal, but things that would cause embarrassment or hardship in someone's life, or associated with fiends in some way.

7. Warning! Frightful Presence Ahead: Players expect a Dragon or something with Frightful Presence, only to find a pile of wrapped gifts.

12. The ground of one area is rough, like a cheese grater. There is a large door with the warning 'beware of dragon'. If a player grabs onto the doorknob he gets stuck to it. The doorknob becomes animated and starts draggin' the player across the rough floor, causing severe scrapes all over the body. /regularjoe42](

If you succeed in opening the locked box, there is a puff of pinkish-purple smoke and the character finds themselves looking like the well endowed feminine statue holding the warning. /Ninten\_Joe](
24. Snake Pit: The party fight their way through a swarm of venomous snakes to find a fruit tree whose trunk looks like several smaller trees woven together. The tree shakes violently at their approach, flinging large fruits everywhere. These fruits break open on the next turn, releasing snakes from where their seeds should be. /Ninten\_Joe](
25. Shock Trap: The party notice their vision is a little hazy as they enter a corridor. There was a warning about testing their metal. They are suddenly assaulted by illusions of all sorts of frightening and horrifying things and must succeed CON saves or be Frightened by the shocking images. /Ninten\_Joe](
26. Rat Trap: The party finds themselves in a labyrinth after attempting to aid an old lady with her ‘rat problem’. They will likely end up being pursued around the twists and turns by a gigantic rat that can barely fit round some of the tight corners. /Ninten\_Joe](
27. Log trap: The party hear a whoosh as a log suspended over head whizzes a foot over their heads… before the floor drops out from under them and the log drops into the pit after them. /Ninten\_Joe](

29. Glue trap: The party finds a room that appears to be entirely upside down.

Now the pack of Mimics come to life, leaving the party to fight gooey furniture monsters. /Ninten\_Joe](
30. Mousetrap: The party finds themselves at the beginning of some kind of obstacle course with a variety of traps, gaps and challenges to get through. They also notice that a Rube Goldberg contraption has started a timer, and a giant cage will fall over their exit of they’re not fast enough! /Ninten\_Joe](
31. Trapjacks: The route forward is covered in strange, colourfully painted boxes. Approaching one causes it to play a childish melody, getting faster the closer you get. If you pass within 5 ft of one or end your turn within 10 ft, it rapidly plays the full melody of ‘Pop goes the Weasel’ before spraying caltrops within a 30 ft radius and revealing a clockwork clown on a spring (a Jack in the Box) that begins hurling darts at the closest target within 120 ft until the players escape the room/corridor. /Ninten\_Joe](
32. Shut yer Trap!: While moving through a forest, one player triggers an invisible bear trap. As they take damage and cry out in pain, they realise they cannot speak or make any noise at all. Even the sound of the trap being set off was muted by a Silence spell. They better hope their allies notice they’re in danger, as the trap restrains them until they are released or can pass a STR check to open/reset the trap. They might notice a couple of other victims (or at least their remains) on their route. /Ninten\_Joe](
33. Honey trap: The party must pass through a room filled with lustful men and women all engaging in… amorous activities. They’ll quickly realise it’s an illusion… mostly an illusion anyway. Once they realise it’s not real, they’ll discover the sucubus/incubus hiding amongst the illusions who, once spotted, will attack. (Works just as well at a rich nobles party when the distractions are real people who will run out screaming once the demons are discovered). /Ninten\_Joe](
34. Clap trap: After a circus passed through town, several people went missing. While investigating, the party will have to be careful not to avoid the same fate, and be charmed to join the audience permanently, constantly giving round after round of applause to the same acts over and over again. /Ninten\_Joe](
35. Fireball trap : The players are doused in a quantity of cinnamon scented liquor equivalent to force a reflex save or be knocked prone. /DogmaSychroniser](

37. (A)net(te) trap: The image of a beautiful woman appears before the players and begins to talk. Players standing within 20ft must make a will save or be stunned for three rounds. As long as the woman keeps talking then the players must make a new roll every turn if they're not already stunned. Can be dispelled as though cast as a major illusion. Deaf or blind characters are affected though have an advantage to their DC. Deaf and blind characters are wholly unaffected. /DogmaSychroniser](

424,"Some examples

1. The physiology of a stuffed bear. If you are torn apart, you can simply push the stuffing back in and sew yourself back together.

2. You can shrivel into a limp husk weighing no more than a similarly sized piece of cloth. You can ride the wind like a plastic bag and harmlessly fold around most attacks.

3. You can inflate anything you blow into as if it were a balloon

4. You can nap for one second, gaining all of the benefits of 8 hours of sleep."
425,"I run a pf2e campaign set in a desert full of undead. Been playing cult of the lamb lately and like its tarot cards system. It gives you two cards, each with a minor buff, you pick one. 

So my plan is to have them run into a fortune teller who says ""Have five cards, two for you, two for me, and one to burn"" each having different effects. The theory is they can activate two as needed, one can be removed...and the other two are in my hands. 

1. Blood in the Sand-an undead swarm has you as its prey. At a future point they'll swarm you like a wasp in a bees nest. (Let's the user call in mindless undead, and lots/powerful ones at that. While likely a threat...it may prove usable if able to force them onto something else)

2. Gilded Cage-a vast hoard of treasure stands in front of you, but at a cost. A curse, a monster, a trap, stands behind you, aiming to ensure you'll die in this cage(requires found treasure to activate, but makes something harder to leave. May be playable to trap something you want to be stuck in...if you can escape)

3. Burning Sand-The heats been worse recently, are you prepared? Everything's hotter...but that includes blades or enemies(depending who activates it) but also requires saves against heat. 

4 Frozen Sands-Desert nights are cold, (basically inverse of burning sands)

5. Winds Of Change-something in the sands has changed...or is it about to change? No matter, it will affect you soon (change a circumstance either for the better or worse, be it a sinkhole under a collapsed tunnel, filling itself with the rubble making a path, or a sandstorm striking at the worst time)

6. Hearts-the beating of a heart is rarely troublesome, after all, it can restore to life someone. (Full heal a player, or an enemy)"
426,"In a world of superheroes, not everyone *wants* to be a law-enforcement officer of the law, bashing criminals and arresting supervillains. Let's think of 1d100 ways these people can apply their superpowers to daily life. I'll be stealing quite a bit of this list from the Wired article of a similar name.

**The Groundrules** - Give the power (or combination of powers, if it's too long just say like ""Green Lantern"" to embody the suite of powers of a specific superhero) and the job title, followed by the description of how it would happen.

**Limitations** - Let's avoid magic. Instead, give the actual application of the magic as its own superpower - like, instead of ""Magic"", put in Telekinesis if the magic is being used to levitate things.

Also, let's avoid super-intelligence or inventor / gadgeteer type superpowers, because they're just too versatile and might end up with ""Build [obviously useful thing]"". Let's also avoid ""atomic manipulation"" or however else you'd describe Dr. power suite - the entire point of the character is that he can do *anything*.

Lastly, the superpower must be used in benefit of others, not just of one person.

1. Telekinesis - Space Assembly Technician - It's really hard to build stuff in a 0G environment. Telekinisis bypasses all of that and makes it trivially easy.

2. Super Speed OR Teleportation - Courier - Doing the fastest deliveries ever. I don't think this would be useful in a large scale, but it would be quite useful for stuff like organ deliveries, where it's paramount that someone receive something in a very limited amount of time.

3. Phasing OR Elasticity - Electrician / Plumber - Doesn't need to break walls to do your job.

4. Super Senses OR Echolocation (for caves and things like that) - First Responder - The all-in-one rescue team who can figure out exactly where the people are after a natural disaster.

5. Healing Factor OR Invulnerability - Test Pilot - Serving science by taking a wicked strong painkiller and letting people point and prod to learn more about the human body and how it changes under stress.

6. X-Ray Vision - Airport Security - The most non-invasive method of looking for bombs and things like that.

7. Telepathy - Screening Doctor - Doesn't need to listen to the patient, just read their mind and get exactly what they're feeling.

8. Phasing - Surgeon - Another non-invasive method of doing medicine. Just stick your hand into folks and put shit back into place.

9. Elemental Control OR Weather Manipulation - In-Ship Elemental Officer - Put one of these guys on the appropriate ship. If they can control water / ice, then you don't need icebreaker, or can be relied to avoid the worst waves. If they can control the air, put them aboard airplanes and balloons to avoid falling.

10. Super Speed - Picker / Farmer - A machine is probably more precise, but a speedster can probably clear a field in a pinch to avoid crops rotting for lack of manual labor to go and harvest them.

11. Super Strength / Superman Suite - Human Plow - Someone strong enough and who can fly can simply plow a bunch of fields much more quickly that any machine. Not very practical since, again, a machine is more useful, but can be done in a pinch.

12. Telekinesis - First Responder (Earthquakes) - Someone who can hold together a building to not let it fall apart until everyone is safe.

13. Fire / Water Control - Firefighter - Self explainable.

14. Plant Manipulation - Agriculturist / Humanitarian Corps - Humans don't *need* someone who can magically grow an aubergine to its full size in a couple minutes, Mother Earth does all that work for free, but someone like this could be deployed somewhere where people are going hungry and quickly making healthy food.

15. Plant Manipulation - Terraforming Officer - Easily making poor soil into great soil. Possibly helping to contain the desertification of the Sahel region, trying to keep the Great Barrier Reef alive, and maybe even working on reclaiming the Sahara. Someone like this could even be sent to Mars to make its soil more hospitable to human life.

16. Earth Manipulation - Land Reclamation Officer - A water manipulator won't always be handy to act as a human polder. It's much more effective for an earth manipulator to simply raise the land out of the sea and make it sustainable. If needed, erecting seawalls.

17. Heat Control - Nuclear Accident Prevention Technician - Someone who can be deployed whenever a nuclear plant gets dangerously hot to cool things down.

18. Telepathy - Therapist - Just start digging into someone's mind and figuring out exactly what they mean to tell you is already a big part of therapy.

19. Super Strength / Telekinesis - Construction Worker - I'm sure it's useful to carry a lot of shit at once. Civil engineering involves much more than that, of course, but it could be useful in the context of emergency habitats and humanitarian works.

20. Telepathy - Political Commentator - Politics are almost impervious to superpowers, but someone who can tell what others are thinking and detect lies would change the entire game.

21. Illusions - Teacher - It would be a huge help to students everywhere if they could visualize exactly what the teacher is talking about.

22. Postcognition - Archeologist / Forensics - Touching someone and being able to see what happened before here? That would be a boon to archeology and to forensics.

23. Astral Projection / Phasing - Archeologist - On that same note, being able to enter places without breaking anything or altering how they look would be extremely useful.

24. Super Speed / Electricity Manipulation - Backup Power Grid Officer - In case of a blackout, you can throw a speedster in a threadmill or get a electricity manipulator to keep the power grid going for vital places just until the engineers can figure out what went wrong.

25. Self-Multiplication - Researcher - This one is tough because, well, it's useful for basically anything just because ""having a bunch of people doing one thing"", but I think if we only had one of such persons, having them do different parts of scientific research at the same time would probably be the most beneficial way to approach it.

26. Flying - Photographer - Photography is really important y'all. Not just as an art, but like, being able to capture the magnitude of a situation from a point of view that no one else could would really change a lot of things, provided the flyer is nearby.

27. The Thing Suite - Deep Sea Operator - Anyone like Thing, Juggernaut, or Hulk, who's very heavy and doesn't need to breathe, is very useful for being able to walk on the seafloor and, idk, do construction there or research.

28. Healing - EMT - 'Nuff said. 

29. Invisibility - Biologist / Natural Life Photographer or Researcher- A huge issue that fieldwork in biology has is being noticed by the animals fundamentaly changes how they behave. Someone who can fully camouflage themselves (and their smells and sounds, I imagine) would be able to see animals doing things they'd never do in the presence of humans.

30. Superman Suite - Rocket Technician - Someone who can fly AND is super powerful would advance space tech very rapidly. It wouldn't make rockets obsolete, I imagine, because scientists *need* to know if the thing is gonna blow up in their face, and launch is when you find that out, but someone who can simply take shit to orbit and leave it there would make life easier for sure.

31. Water Manipulation - River Reclaimer - Sure you can just stop dumping shit on the river and wait a while to purify it, but someone with this power could do it immediately, which would save a lot of wildlife.

32. Flight / Superman Suite - Wildfire Firefighter - I don't think someone with this power would be more effective than an airplane equipped with water tanks, but they could cover a lot more ground than a normal ranger and detect wildfires before they begin to spread.

33. Flight / Superman Suite - Ballistic Misile Defense Officer - Basically a guy who can see and catch missiles and nuclear warheads, and redirect them whenever necessary. Probably wouldn't be a full time job unless it's, like, a Yemeni superhero.

34. Telepathy - Census Worker - Someone who can quickly read the minds of people in a wide radius would be wondrous to make a census. Still, it would take a long long while, but idk there might be ways of amplifying their powers.

35. Super Speed - Road and Highway Surveyor - Someone who can run through all of the major roads in a city quickly and compile a report on where repairs are necessary would be most useful, provided the local government doesn't know already.

36. Disintegration - Nuclear Waste Management - Someone who can straight up break down nuclear waste would make life on Earth much more tolerable.

37. Magnetism Control - Landmine Locator - Locating land mines is a very dangerous job, but someone with an innate sense for where metal is located and who can just lift it off the ground harmlessly would be very useful.

38. Telekinesis / Magnetism Control - Bomb Defusal - Someone who's invulnerable might blow the bomb up and create lots of property damage. Someone who can lift the bomb and hold it somewhere where it can blow up without hurting others would be much more safe.

39. Heat / water control could be a chef, baker, greenhouse owner. [/pennyraingoose]

40. Deadpool wall breaking: theologian that can truly prove existence of higher powers [/Nitemare0005]

41. Telepathy - Translator for people that cannot talk because of some illness or accident (if she knows the language), Hostage Negotiator as he knows what's going on in the mind of the other, Rescue Helper after Avalanches or Earthquakes or other catastrophes where people might be burried or unable to talk. Body Guard who detects malicious thoughts before someone shoots. [/Rubikow]

42. Extreme self healing and regeneration - Wolverine/Deadpool. Cleaning up radioactive or other hazardous zones. Doctor without borders as diseases are no problem. Organ donor. Stuntman. Sky Marshal or body guard as they could easily survive attacks and therefore fight them off. Biologist in jungle areas, to research poisonous, venomous and other dangerous animals. [/Rubikow]

43. Weather control - Storm. Farmer - for obvious reasons. Crew memeber of a ship to guarantee good winds and weather. Wind park CEO. Member of regreening desert area projects. Firefighter as the rain will always be right on spot. Ice-cream parlor as it is always sunny and hot if you want. Profi Surfer that got the best waves. Tornado researcher/Storm chaser. Airship pilot. [/Rubikow]

44. Laser eyes - cyclops. Working in the metal industry to heat, melt, weld parts. Working in the teardown industry. Human laser in the research industry. Clering dangerous areas in the nature such as mountain passes. Digging tunnels for traffic and infrastructure. Miner without a pickaxe. [/Rubikow]

45. Freezing power - Iceman. Obviously a job as an ice-cream parlor or in the food industry for cooling. Biologist that helps recreating the poles for anias to live there. Fire fighter. The guy that creates ice sculptures for events and parties. [/Rubikow]

46. Teleport self and thibgs or people you touch - Nightcrawler. Delivery service guy. Messenger. Rescue Helper. Travel agent. [/Rubikow]

47. Shape-shifting- Mystique - Movie Actor or Actor double or stand-up comedian. Help witnesses of crimes at the police station to describe criminals by transforming into them. Helping surgeons to show patients what they will look like after the operation. Help people recreate old photos by posing as the younger versions of them. Help creating historical documentations. Show people how they will look with tattoos or new hair cuts or dyes or how they will look if they loose weight to motivate them. [/Rubikow]

48. Antman - conducting delicate repairs/inspections inside machines/devices without requiring dismantling etc. [/eDaveUK]

49. Earth Control / Stone Control - Mining or Tunneling - You can avoid costly equipment or explosive and just move and shape the stone out of the way. [/World_of_Ideas]

55. Radiation Projection - Sterilization Specialist - They can sterilizer surfaces, objects, and food. Killing all the bacteria that might be on it. [/World_of_Ideas]

57. Metal Control - Jeweler - They can simply shape the metal into whatever jewelry you desire. [/World_of_Ideas]

58. Heal Others - Any Medical Field or Veterinarian - Simply heal wounds without the need for surgery or medicine. [/World_of_Ideas]"

428,"Ahoy.

I'm going to be rolling a Goblin Rogue (smuggler) and as part of the aesthetics I have taken a big chunk out of one of his ears.  I want to create a running gag over the course of the campaign where any time a party member (or anyone else for that matter) asks about it he can rattle off a quick explanation but it is rarely the same story.  Could be a serious response or a joke, simple or complex but WHICH ONE IS THE TRUTH?  He's spent a lot of time around seafarers and is unusually charismatic for a goblin. He would be considered by those who know him as a ""gobo that knows how to get things"".

Any contributions will be greatly appreciated!

&#x200B;

3. THE ONE PIECE an ultimate treasure at the end of the world. **Twist:** When people start to stop believing in it. A well known pirate validates it with their dying breath (One Piece)

432,"Okay, I have a weird one for you guys. The setting of the game I am DMing is a city that is going through space. Think of it like a generational ship, but its a medieval city instead. My PC (who is a wizard) wants to look into weird happenings, mysteries, investigations, etc. as a side-gig. This type of game is fairly new to me, and him wanting to be an investigator of weird things is also new. Therefore, I'm having quite a bit of trouble coming up with a bunch of ideas. Thanks so much in advance for any help!

A little bit about the city: Firstly, it is surrounded by a giant icy orb that keeps it intact - the wizards maintain this orb through simple cantrips and level 1 spells. There are no animals, they only eat mushrooms and seaweed, and there is a very strict birth law in place due to genetics and lack of space. It's run by an elected council, and there are some people who believe the wizards are keeping them from escaping this forever wormhole they seem to be stuck in, while other believe the city hasn't reached it's destination yet. Oh and they use their dead as fertilizer. I know it's weird, but I just go where the inspiration takes me. :)

I would prefer the ideas to be as much in the realm of this city as possible, but I'm open to any ideas that I might be able to change into something that fits! Thanks again!

\*Edit: Thanks so much for all your ideas so far! They are really fun and are helping me out a lot!

1. A section of the mycelium farm is dying rapidly with seemingly no source of contamination.
2. Someone's body was mutilated and the officers cannot figure out what may have killed them.
3. People have been disappearing near the water area, and no one can figure out where they have gone.
4. Wizards are being attacked and murdered brutally.
5. For some reason, people are finding it almost impossible to get pregnant.
6. The mirrors. Residents report stories of mirror reflections failing to reflect properly, sometimes having a life of thier own...  [**MaxSizeIs**](
7. **T**he Day-Night Cycle has drifted from standard specifications. The ritual time keepers insist there is no difference, but it should be day at noon, and night at midnight, instead it is dawn at midnight and dusk at noon! [**MaxSizeIs**](
8. THERE ARE NO BEES ON THE STATION. Everyone in charge says so. Why do residents report hearing swarms in the void spaces between walls? When someone turns up dead from stings, what caused it? [**MaxSizeIs**](
9. The Mycellium farm product tastes different. Some residents have turned up missing. [**MaxSizeIs**](
10. A resident insists that the contents of a rare, and therefore protected tome, have changed. They insist it says something different than it used to. This would have no impact, usually, but they are gaining adherents who demand it changed back.. [**MaxSizeIs**](
11. There aren't enough people dying. Somehow the birth rates havent changed, but seemingly there are fewer than normal deaths, and the garden-gravemasters are noting a lack of new fertilizer, and nutrient deficiencies. [**MaxSizeIs**](
12. Find the leak. Water reserves across the entire system have dropped by a total of one hundred and seventeen gallons over the course of a year, this unaccounted trend must be stopped or compensated for. [**MaxSizeIs**](
13. There have reports of Strange knights wandering the land that do not respond to hails. (Repair robots are traveling around trying to fix things.)   [**Adventux**](
14. An elected official found several human teeth in their food, and believes it to be an attempt on their life. [**bitch\_beefman**](
15. A small cult is forming in the poor district, but nobody seems to want to speak about them. [**bitch\_beefman**](
16. There have been several reported sightings of rats in a certain part of the city -- a very valuable potential food source, if true. [**bitch\_beefman**](
17. A mushroom the size of a small tree was found growing in a recently deceased citizen's living quarters, and it's proving very difficult to remove.  [**bitch\_beefman**](
18. There have been rumors of someone selling human meat on the black market. [**bitch\_beefman**](
19. Healthy people have been suddenly dropping dead at random for no discernable reason. [**bitch\_beefman**](
20. A newborn baby was found stranded in the road, no one is claiming ownership of it.  [**NecessaryCornflake7**](
21. A section of the icy orb is melting and losing its thickness, no one knows why. [**NecessaryCornflake7**](
22. Members of the council continue to fall sick or get injured in mysterious ways, some citizens believe a perpetrator is behind this. [**NecessaryCornflake7**](
23. There is a rumor that Maintenance Staff have found something in the ice, everyone is speculating what it is, but no one can confirm if, when, where, or what was found, by whom. [**MaxSizeIs**](
24. You must go outside; Outside the protective ice that is. There is an isolated observation post on the outside nadir of the icy sphere, and there have been claims of random fires in the equipment there that keep damaging it...[**MaxSizeIs**](
25. They say a new passage has been rediscovered in the ice, and brass clockwork vessels capable of leaving the icy sphere have been located. No-one readily confesses to having seen such a thing directly, and such tales have been dismissed by officials...[**MaxSizeIs**](
26. A citizen has been found assaulted and near death, but cannot remember who or what attacked them.[**MaxSizeIs**](
27. One morning, when the gravedigger comes to the cemetery, he discovers that all the tombs are open, and there is no corpses inside.  [**Sandro2017**](
28. A strange new illness has appeared in town that makes people unable to sleep. [**Sandro2017**](
29. The count has been assassinated in his private chambers. Well, not the actual count, but a doppelganger with his face. Who killed the impostor and where is the real count? [**Sandro2017**](
30. Rumor says that farmers and shepherds from a region are seeing strange flying things at night. [**Sandro2017**](
31. ""Have you seen this man?"" Reads a poster at a local inn, with a drawing of a face on it. A lot of people on the city have seen the same man on their dreams... [**Sandro2017**](

10. A well-dressed hobgoblin carts around on top of a throne-like chair with hand poles is hoisted up and carried by several servant goblins. A small goblinoid army follows in front of him as the hobgoblin orders the goblins to attack. The hobgoblin reaches beside the chair for a stash of bombs.

440,"Hello all,

I'm running a Genepunk Supers Campaign soon and I've decided that every superpower has some sort of weird and random kryptonite that immediately shuts down their power and I need some help coming up with a list my players can choose from and/or use as reference for creating their own. The kryptonite only kicks in if the character is touching the item or actively experiencing the scenario (see below). Also, this kryptonite does not need to correspond to their power.

Post your suggestions below and I'll add to the list until I get 100:

1. Half a Baguette
2. Being in a Red Room
3. 10"" Griswold Cast Iron Skillet
4. Type AB+ Blood
5. Braided Hair
6. Fast Food
7. Dr. Pepper
8. Their Parents
9. Hawaiian Shirts
10. Uggs Boots
11. Dabbing
12. Kazoo ""Music""
13. Hot Beverages
14. Chihuahua Dogs
15. On Their Birthday
16. Therapists
17. Reggae
18. The Word ""Plane""
19. Japanese Giant Hornets
20. Moonlight
21. Rotary Phones
22. Moderate Winds
23. Being Happy"
441,"Curses a la lycanthropy, Lolth's drider curse, baleful polymorph, Devlin's Staff of Striking, etc.

1. Lycanthropy
2. Turn into a shadow. Can still interact with objects and attack, but gain a disadvantage on STR checks and advantage on stealth checks
3. Feet turn into flippers, movement speed is reduced by half
4. Grow goat horns
5. Gain the lower body of a random animal(a la centaur)"
442,"You approach the fortress of memories, the stronghold and home of the Raven Queen. You see it as a towering castle of white marble, stained glass and siege fortifications, you look at your companion, to gauge their reaction, but when your look back- the castle has become a manor house, heavy Gargoyles grimace and guard vaulted windows and ceramic rooftops. 

Each time you turn to look at the fortress, its architecture changes and morphs around you. 

What do you see?

1.	Gothic castle, gargoyles, vaulted windows
2.	 Sultans palace, golden domes and empty windows
3.	shakespearian manor house, dark wood supports and whitewashed walls.
4.	 A mighty volcano, spewing smoke and flame, with a burning entrance at its base.
5.	 A mausoleum, heavy pillars open to a downward leading staircase."
443,"Hello! This is a continuation of my last post here (which is now hidden to follow the sub's rules), so I can separate old answers from new ones. I need some more help brainstorming ideas for my D&D realm known as the *Isles of Etherwolfe*.

From my last post: ""Due to a worldbuilding secret I shall not share ^(due to my players definitely spying on my profile), spectral ‘Echoes’ from past worlds have a chance of slipping through the cracks, appearing as cryptic ethereal images that often have no connection to the world. They are simply remnants of previous worlds, other civilizations, “alien” species \[and D&D races\] like strange other version of elves, etc. These Echoes could even be specific \[worldbuilding\] references from ***your world*** or other D&D worlds, anything! Make them strange, make them mysterious, make them unexplained, and let’s create a cool list of ideas!""

**Update 1**: I've received a ton of interesting 'scenes' for these echoes, but from now on, let's try to make things more stagnant, like strange objects appearing in places they shouldn't, or ruins of old castles, etc. For instance, 11) A lone sailing ship, lilting to the side. The ropes and wheel still gently move despite the lack of any crew. /HordeOfAngryBees]( or 32) a ruined and partially collapsed castle, structured using large brass pipes; once a center of learning and discovery for steam powered technology /nexorati]( **Don't forget that these echoes can be specific references to other worlds** (I've gotten some cool Eberron and Faerun stuff, but let's keep expanding!). Try to keep them relatively grounded in medieval High Fantasy. I appreciate the modern references, but I think we've collected enough of them in the table!

**Update 2**: Try to keep your responses a bit short, at around 3-ish lines. As I input your responses into my document, I've been trimming some of them down or beefing them up to match the rest, but their primary idea has obviously stayed the same :)

**Update 4**: We've officially reached *100 Echoes from the Past*! Thank you all so much for your contributions, it means the world to me to have such amazing help on this mysterious idea of mine, and I'm so glad that so many of you enjoyed it! Feel free to use this list in your worlds and campaigns, and I'd love to hear about your player's crazed reactions! For now, this will be the finalized list and I think I'll keep my edited version to myself, since they will be essentially the same anyways. But thank you all, and have a wonderful adventure!

**Echoes from the Past:**

Note: Most, if not all of these Echoes should appear Spectral, as if being seen on the Ethereal Plane.

d100. Echo

1. A cathedral dedicated to an unknown deity (flower symbol) inhabited by strange elves.
2. A small river flowing north, which suddenly turns upward and floats into the air and disappears

6. The ruins of a greek-style bank run by a collection of metallic-skinned halflings.
7. Various flapping banners staked into the ground representing the different elements.
8. A row of hundreds of humanoid statues. In fact, they are the same statue expressed over hundreds of years. The ones in the front are broken and weathered, the ones in the middle gleam with paint and polish, and the final ones are uncarved plinths of stone. /onepostandbye](
9. A stone building can be seen in different eras depending what side you view it from. Entering from the basement entrance allows PCs to interact with a disoriented shopkeeper. /onepostandbye](
10. The upper slope of this area displays many tilting grave markers. Where the land has eroded, spectral skeletons float as if in repose, their spectral headstones floating six feet above. /onepostandbye](
11. A lone sailing ship, lilting to the side. The ropes and wheel still gently move despite the lack of any crew. /HordeOfAngryBees](
12. A massive, thick wall of trees standing in a circle. Inside of the circle is a clearing where snow gently falls around an old cabin. /HordeOfAngryBees](
13. A colossal warforged titan stands atop a hill, its sadness palpable. It slams its fists down on a column of soldiers, the ground trembling from the force. More soldiers advance, siege weapons primed to fire. /NecessaryCornflake7](
14. A flying ship with a ring of fire descends over an elegant Victorian city, full of twinkling lights. /NecessaryCornflake7](
15. A lightning rail stops at a station in a small wilderness town, its energy connecting to the conductor stones in the ground. /NecessaryCornflake7](
16. On another hill, shrouded in fog, a dilapidated one-story cabin emits a beam of blue light, summoning zombies and skeletons clothed in ruined soldier equipment begin to emerge from the fog. /NecessaryCornflake7](
17. An echo of a community endlessly replays one hour of mundane village life. The village met some terrible end, and when PCs move close to persons, objects, or buildings, the echo temporarily dissolves to show the current state of the place, which is ugly and sad. /onepostandbye](
18. The father guided his son, teaching him how to properly aim and bend the bowstring. In the lush forest, a deer suddenly appeared in the clearing. Whispering instructions, the father watched as the boy released the arrow. /NecessaryCornflake7](
19. The mother watched unamused as her children fought over a toy in the front yard of the tree house. She abruptly stopped the fight by taking away the toy and instructed them on how to treat each other better. The scolding brought tears of sorrow to the children, but the mother was quick to comfort them with a hug and kisses, reassuring them of her love. /NecessaryCornflake7](
20. A grandpa and their granddaughter ventured deep into the magical forest together to collect wild berries. As they wandered, grandpa spotted something dangerous lurking in the shadows. He quickly drew his granddaughter closer and shielded them with his magical staff, ready to protect her from the unseen danger. /NecessaryCornflake7](
21. An exhausted salaryman walking from the glass box of their office to their old Geo Metro, while above them looms a planet, of awesome size, lit by no sun. A dark titan, all thick black forests and jagged mountains and deep turbulent oceans. /MaxSizeIs](
22. Impossibly tall metal towers made of impossibly slender sticks, while lonely red light pulses slowly at it's top. Disturbing black birds hunch menacingly, roosting upon it in great numbers. Hallucinatory, ethereal music in no recognizable style seems to buzz within one's teeth as they draw near to the apparition. /MaxSizeIs](
23. A strangely dressed man sitting behind a desk while a confusing array of boxers and esoteric instruments sit before him. He talks in an unknown language, fiddles with one of the instruments, placing a black disc upon a sort of spinning table, and suddenly from no discernable location, alien music can be heard. /MaxSizeIs](
24. A hard sort of road but made of a sort of greyish black stone that seems poured like a river, it is very wide, and seems to go in both directions forever. Several lines of strange metal boxes, somewhat like carriages, go in both directions, countless in number, rolling slowly, occasionally stopping then starting again in waves, making no noise, and with no-one inside. /MaxSizeIs](
25. A vast canyon, with seemingly infinitely tall towers made of glass on both sides. Every floor of the tower seems to be comfortably furnished in (admittedly alien design), but also appears to have at least one terrified person silently banging on the glass, apparently begging to be let out. Occasionally it rains bodies, they fall from great height from above, then through the ground as if it isn't there, and keep going. /MaxSizeIs](
26. A person in a strange sort of greyish-white diving suit with a large, bulky looking backpack contraption on their back, wielding a striped flag, and bouncing around as if they were almost floating. /MaxSizeIs](

29. A labyrinthine maze with walls higher than a person, extends to the horizon. /MaxSizeIs](
30. A friendly red dog, the size of a large house, with fangs the size of a grown person, and a mouth that could swallow you in one go. It wants to play. /MaxSizeIs](
31. A school of ornamental goldfish, each the size of a blue-whale, just swimming as if the air were water. /MaxSizeIs](
32. a ruined and partially collapsed castle, structured using large brass pipes; once a center of learning and discovery for steam powered technology /nexorati](
33. A caveman sizes up a lightning-struck, burning log, pokes it, and runs away howling in pain. /RealRamessesII](
34. A little girl points toward the entrance of a dark forest, as the unsuspecting farmers walk hesitantly within. Smiling deviously, the girl stays a distance back. Suddenly, large red, illuminated eyes appear from the forest darkness, causing the farmers to scream in terror. /NecessaryCornflake7](
35. A priest, a nobleman, and a guard pass by an old beggar on the street without offering help, but a mixed adventuring party of a tiefling, halfling, dragonborn, and humans stop to give the beggar assistance. In gratitude, the beggar hugs one of them. /NecessaryCornflake7](
36. An exhausted alchemist conducts a complicated experiment with various colored liquids, beakers, and pipes. Upon the completion of the experiment, the gnome jumps with joy, holding the main vial as if it were a new precious child, as the color of the vial has shifted to a solid red, welcoming the new discovery. /NecessaryCornflake7](
37. A young king, resplendent in his finest garments, strode confidently with his entourage of attendants into the city gates. The inhabitants of the city, who lined the streets, remained expressionless and unmoved, their supposed welcome a mere pretense. As they marched on, the imposing silhouette of the castle loomed into view, its grey stone walls shrouded in the morning mist. The king's heart raced with anticipation as he imagined the throne room within, and the destiny that awaited him. /NecessaryCornflake7](
38. A river of liquid copper, gold, or quicksilver. /MaxSizeIs](
39. A giant eye, peering into reality from a crack in the sky. /MaxSizeIs](
40. A carousel, moving, but with no passengers or people around. /MaxSizeIs](
41. An abandoned ice-cream truck, moldering away in a primeval forest, music still playing. /MaxSizeIs](
42. A wall of screens taller than a person and a mile long, each playing a different episode of the same sitcom, out of order and with no context. Occasionally the screens talk to each other, as if they know the other episodes are there, or that someone may be watching them, then the episode ends and the next one starts. The same exact episode is never played more than once. /MaxSizeIs](
43. Hidden among all these Echoes is an actual Ghost. /CptnR4p3](
44. The ground shakes as a long forgotten behemoth creature walks by only to fade from existance. /FirstChAoS](

53. An ominous horseman in a crimson cape and hood, standing silently on the top of a hill. His eyes are blank and he doesn't have lips, showing all of his front teeth. He seems to look fait away in the horizon. /Sans-Mot](
54. For centuries, a fierce battle has been raging in the skies above a city. On one side is a powerful angelic figure, a divine embodiment of justice, righteousness and goodness. On the other side is its demonic counterpart, a force of malevolence and wickedness. The fate of the city hangs in the balance, as its citizens await the outcome of this epic struggle between good and evil. If the angelic figure prevails, the city will be blessed with peace, joy and contentment, while a victory for the demonic figure will plunge the city into darkness, despair and chaos. /NecessaryCornflake7](
55. Two young lovers in a tight embrace, lounging together as they watched the beautiful sunrise that stretched out over the towering view in front of them. Despite the uncertainty of their future and the restrictions their parents and society had imposed on them, they committed to do everything in their power to make their relationship work. They shared a moment of peace, admiring the beauty of the sunrise and dreaming of the possibilities that lay ahead of them. /NecessaryCornflake7](
56. The warrior kneels beside his friend, who is gravely injured from the battle that is still raging around them. He takes his hand, feeling the warmth and life slowly fading away.

The dying warrior looks up at him with a grateful and familiar smile, and with one last breath, his soul departs. The kneeling warrior grasps his friend's hand tightly, holding back tears as he silently bids farewell. /NecessaryCornflake7](
57. The authoritative knight galloped through the street on his trusted steed, seemingly without a care for the citizens around him. A small young boy stood in his path, seemingly about to be run over when a heroic young girl jumped in front of him and managed to stop the knight in his tracks. The knight, completely oblivious of the danger he had almost caused, continued on his path, leaving the young boy with a sense of shock and awe. The young boy quickly recovered, and with a humble sense of gratitude, thanked the girl for saving him. /NecessaryCornflake7](
58. A scrawny stray cat cautiously trots up to a homeless woman, who was leaning against a wall, fast asleep. The woman stirred and opened her eyes, only to find the tiny cat rubbing against her leg. Her face lit up with a warm smile and she reached into her bag to pull out a bowl of water and a few scraps of food. The cat eagerly lapped up the cool water and devoured the food, purring appreciatively as it nestled in the woman's outstretched arms. /NecessaryCornflake7](
59. A large library is the backdrop for an unlikely duo - a half-orc barbarian and an elf wizard. The wizard is patiently instructing the half-orc in the basics of reading and writing, starting with the alphabet.

60. A regal demon prince lounged around a luxurious dinner table in a dimly lit hall, attended by a troupe of beguiling succubi, serving his every need.

The rest of the party rallies around them in solidarity and support. /NecessaryCornflake7](
66. Several brilliant stars illuminated the landscape, gradually moving closer to one another. Suddenly, they collided and created a mesmerizing display of colors, with hues of blue, green, yellow, and red fanning out in all directions. A devastating force surged through the countryside, serenading the land with a beautiful yet destructive sight. /NecessaryCornflake7](
67. A heavy rainstorm swept in over the hilly pasture land, the moist wind whipping through the tall grass and bending it to its will. Streaks of lightning illuminated the dark, rain-filled sky, casting a dramatic backdrop to the scene. A small cluster of cows had huddled together under the shelter of a few trees, seeking safety and respite from the raging storm. /NecessaryCornflake7](
68. The warforged creature stands in the middle of a vast junkyard, its single arm and damaged leg starkly contrasting with the piles of gleaming metal and wooden pieces that surround it. Its glowing eyes search the mounds, hastily selecting a few choice pieces to inspect and fit onto its body. With its single arm, it delicately lifts a metal appendage and attaches it to the place where its missing limb should be. It then picks up a wooden leg and affixes it to its damaged one, replacing it with a functioning limb. After a few moments, the warforged tests out its new arm and leg, its body adapting to its newfound mobility. /NecessaryCornflake7](
69. A poor mother, surrounded by her children, sits together on the floor of a drab and sparsely furnished hut. As her children huddle around her, she gently guides them in a simple prayer for provision, asking for divine aid in these difficult times. As if in answer to their pleas, a knock suddenly sounds on the door. Upon opening it, the family finds a box filled with food, clothes, and other essential items donated by an anonymous figure with a knowing smile. Unbeknownst to the family, the mysterious individual is an agent of their deity, answering the prayer with a tangible act of kindness. /NecessaryCornflake7](
70. The old half-elf, dressed in luxurious noble robes and carrying an ornate ice staff, finished an important meeting with several rulers. After the meeting concluded, he stepped through a magical portal into a more private area. As soon as he emerged from the portal, the half-elf transformed into a majestic white dragon. With a powerful beat of its wings, it soared into the sky, flying off on a determined mission. /NecessaryCornflake](
71. A gigantic skull half-sunk into the ground. Like, bigger-than-a-house-gigantic. What the hell killed this thing?
72. A grave absolutely covered with bouquets, piles of coins and other offerings. You can't even make out the name on the headstone.
73. Two identical elves fight furiously, wailing on each other with bare fists -- the echo fades away before you can see who wins...
74. A giant portal, pulsating with energy -- the solid metal rim is carved with incomprehensible characters.
75. A shattered shipwreck with the name still visible on the hull: ""Never-Shall-Sink"".
76. A handsome man rides back and forth on horseback, he appears to be giving some sort of speech. Suddenly an arrow comes out of nowhere and splits his head open. If only he wore a helmet...
77. A country well that an angry ghost floats above (what does one call an echo of a ghost?)
78. An ornate throne with a small gem set into the top. If you squint, you think you can see something swirling within the gem...
79. A perfectly circular area of lifeless dirt, surrounded by grass and flowers.
80. A pristine merchant's stall, miles from any civilization.
81. The corpse of some sort of humanoid beetle in strange wooden armor, stabbed through the heart.
82. A humongous telescope, with smoke pouring out the top end.
83. A bookstore with a sign out front reading: ""The Ascension Guide -- The Last Book You'll Ever Need"".
84. The remnants of a crude, abandoned campsite. A tree in the middle has hundreds of tally marks scratched into it.
85. A rope bridge across a chasm (better hope you recognize this as an echo ahead of time...)
86. A mithril and adamantine anvil, half melted. The anvil is the size of a house. Large Orichalcum chains are half-forged atop it, half-melted in a puddle of amalgamation.
87. A monolithic basaltic intrusion, a grandly-intricate temple carved around and inside, with seemingly uncountable finely-decorated holes of various size. A keening whistle across eight octaves is audible, resembling that of a single voice screaming in torment. The sound appears to be emanating from the holes via a veritable gale of air.
88. Storm-wracked seas, upon the horizon is visible a much weather-beaten tablet made of fired red clay, half-submerged, and etched with a series of magically untranslatable glyphs (visible even from the great distance)-- literally any attempt to translate the glyphs features a different result, usually inane greetings and well-wishes between non-existent (as far as the best scholars can determine) heads of state, fictitious (again, as far as Scholars can determine) historical accounts or records of harvests and weather that never happened, and occasionally some profound but ultimately disprovable (after much tortuous study) logical or paradoxical statement. The appearance of the tablet is dangerously deceptive; the tablet is nigh-on infinitely large, and equally far away, and the stormy sea is effectively boundless.
89. A shadowy mist appears out of nowhere, either delivering a drained shell of a person or taking one away.
90. Two dark slits appear in the air and multiple ghastly faces surrounded by dark smokes step out from one, into the other.
91. Hearing the echoes of a shattered dream, the soul with it's fate incomplete falls into despair. It is apparent that their negative quirks are enhanced, in the span of what it feels like decades.
92. A beam of light appears and in it you see a travelling caravan, what appears to be moving towards a city of light surrounded in corpse-gray sky.
93. A group of paladins and clerics runs by, panicked, seemingly dodging something shooting out of the sky and looking back horrified. One of the clerics is screaming at her holy symbol to apparently no avail. The group suddenly begins to sprint before vanishing into smoke.
94. A blue dragonborn goes flying by, riding on top of a massive white dragon. Further on a group of adventurers uses what appears to be Scry, looking off in the direction the pair went before heading off.
95. In the shadow of ruins engraved with barbaric images of demons slaughtering humanoids a young elvish man bows and pleads before a large demon and his cohort, a black winged female looking on with pity. With a deep sigh the demons claws reach and tear out his soul, wrapping around a chain of other souls and giving orders to the elf.
96. The faces of the citizens in the city were filled with horror as molten lava and ash spewed from the sky, crashing down upon them. With no warning or time to prepare, the people frantically ran with whatever possessions, friends, and family members they could carry, in a desperate hope of surviving the sudden disaster. The fear and shock of the situation was written clearly in their stunned expressions, unable to comprehend what had happened.
97. The soldiers charged forward with determined energy, the ground shaking beneath their feet as they sprinted towards their opponents in battle. As they closed in on their enemy, the tension in the air was palpable. Patient archers with drawn bows waited patiently for their commanding officer to call to fire, their faces determined and focused. As the soldiers came within a few steps of their opponents, the officer finally brought his hand down, and the archers released their arrows. The sky filled with an onslaught of arrows, and the majority of the charging soldiers dropped to the ground.
98. A young child, brimming with curiosity, approaches a sleeping dragon cautiously. Suddenly, the child slips on a piece of treasure, alerting the dragon. Its one eye opens to take in the scene before it, and the child recoils in fear, falling to their knees and begging for mercy. Much to the child's surprise, the dragon unfolds its magnificent wings and smiles, offering them a chance to pick from her grand treasure and reassuring them of its peaceful intentions.
99. The gods gathered in an immense chamber with grand chairs, so large they could be mistaken for large buildings. As debate raged over a point of disagreement, a wild storm of elemental energy exploded in the center of the room, representing the strength of their words. When the conflict was resolved, the elements were tamed and entwined, coalescing into a new celestial creature of whichever deity had the most persuasive argument.
100. The wife and husband embrace in a passionate goodbye kiss as tears stream down the woman's face. Her husband promises to come back safely, no matter what. He turns to scoop up his little children, hugging them tightly and encouraging them to be brave and obey their mother. The family holds each other one last time before the man is forced to tear himself away to march with the other soldiers, all of them determined to defend their land."
444,"So, I thought it’d be funny if there was a legging store from a modern mall that was just there in a medieval fantasy world.

35. Thunder Pants: Purple leggings with black lightning bolts. Allows the wearer to cast Shatter on the groin of one enemy within range once per long rest."
445,"So the concept is to have the players make a few rolls to simulate how well travel went. If they do well, they earn a bonus upon arriving for the adventure. If they do poorly they would have an extra obstacle to overcome.

I’m thinking 5 lists of 20 should create a good disparity to not run into the same thing frequently. Please include what tier you think they effect would belong in.

Thanks in advance!

446,"Who are they? What do they do? Is there something slightly off or sinister about them?

1. Upton Phillips is a nervous man, always seeming to be looking over his shoulder, working in shipping cargoes. He spends a lot of time looking at the bay from the porch of his house or the verandah of his office. He spends very little time actually on the docks and almost never sets foot on a boat.
2. Alijah Harrison is a mechanic who seems to be able to get even the most wrecked machine to come to life again. He is way more friendly to passersby than most around town, but quickly stops working whenever a stranger drops by.
3. Meredith Gordon owns a small store where the few shelves contain herbs, dried and fresh. Behind the counter, through a partially open curtain, you can see there are more shelves and although they contain jars, most of them seem to contain something unsettling, floating in liquid.
4. Enoc Young is one of the blacksmiths in town. There is still a call for horse shoes, but not as much as there was twenty years ago, but still he is always busy making something. However, he always covers up what he’s working on when strangers pass by.
5. Johannes Pott is new to the area. He came as a young, enthusiastic vet and worked in the town and the hills around for the first few months. Lately though he seems to spend more time sitting on a bench and gazing out at the bay, than he does tending to the local animals.
6. Yang Min is an orphaned immigrant of asian descent. They have have gained a small measure of local fame capitalizing on a nascent swelling of exoticism in their position as an entertainer, but still struggles with the pressures of racism, and drug addiction problems.
7. George Waldorf Vincent-Smythe; Wealthy Art Collector, and influential member of the Fine Arts Museum in Boston, Mass. The son of a wealthy newspaper editor, and raised in Armenia, Connecticut; gained his fortune partnering with a Carriage-maker in the late '50s, and has dabbling investments in Ford's factories. Known for being a spry 90 years old, and has a full head of shockingly white hair, an equally shockingly white beard, and a deep love for art and aesthetics. Less well-known to the general public, but more influentially to the antiquities brokers world-wide, Smythe supplements his collecting with selling and brokering deals for the growing millionaire collector movement.
8. Tilda Thompson is a maid for any upper classman in town, she is extremely thorough in her work ethic and has a reputation for keeping people's home and grounds immaculate. There are rumors that she has been seen carrying suspicious objects out of houses at night.
9. Damian Garraway is a leatherworker in town. He makes a great jacket or horse saddle and many leatherworkers have tried to seek mentorship from him for his exceptional craftmanship. But he lives like a hermit and doesn't openly reveal where he got his leather from."
447,"I saw this magic item in a reddit forum from a few years back, and I thought it was a good idea: The Wandering Eye is a spyglass that shows the view a random event happening concurrently on the same plane. It can be used once an hour, and there's no sound. I'm hoping to have a d100 table so my PCs can roll for what the see - the problem is that I'm having a hard time coming up with 100 different events. Help me fill in the table?

They could be anything from tiny moments (a mother consoling her child; a blacksmith hammering away) or ones of great import (an assassination taking place; a dragon attacking a town). For context, this is a pirate/exploration themed campaign.

1. An orc mother consoling her crying child, who looks to have a few bruises and a black eye
2. A human man in a brown robe puts away books on a shelf
3. A Dragonborn, Tiefling, and Human travel on a sand-skiff through a desert.
4. A group of halfling famers are working in their fields
5. An elvish woman reading a manuscript, seemingly very moved. 
6. A red dragon reigns fire down upon a village

Here's what I have so far: [
448,"These are quick quirks, details, aesthetics and character archetypes you can add to the veteran/gladiator stat block that will allow them to shine. These can be the hired mercenary, the retired barkeep or the generals advisors:

1. A former ranger that cares for an injured sudo-dragon they found on there travels, the sudo-dragon can only fly for 1d12 rounds throughout 1 day. The former ranger will use the sudo-dragons poison as a part of there traps and attacks.

2. A guard to a wizard that often accompanied them in there journeys to find rare spell components, he was tought various minor arcane skills that better helped him guard the wizard and collect the right materials. He can cast the blade strike and magic stone cantrips, he can also provide a +1d6 bonus to any herbalism or arcana checks.

3. A member of the witch bane militia the hunted down the various sorcerous creatures of the year of cursed berth, an event where a powerful dragon suffuses its elemental essence back into the wild. He holds an ambulate that reduces the level of the first spell that strikes him by 5. He also hold a jar of beetles that glow in the presence of magic.

4. A dramatic and emotional guard that served as a member of the hollow wood ranger conclave, a troupe of mercenaries that utilises slings as there primary weapon. He has a touch of orc in his blood resulting as barely visible fangs and a slightly darker complexion. In his later years he functioned as law enforcement granting them many ability’s in perception and insight.

5. A short but lively and rambunctious young woman that fights using nets and trickery, she holds a cloth that she drapes over her shoulder when walking but quickly fans it out to confuse and e ease her enemy’s, catching there weapons or rushing past them. She will use her vast medical knowledge and speed to rush around the battlefield retreating filled allies and neutralising threats with large nets.


6. ⁠An ancient elf that carries a weapon from an age long past. His deep blue eyes reflect experiences that are hard to put into words, so he is often silent. He has a pale skin with a few long snake-like scars across his body.

7. ⁠A charismatic dwarf in a beat up leather armor. Armor has many patches from different cities, he likes to ramble about how he got them, often mixing up stories. His hammer i a little bent, but is still feared by all the scoundrels from the local tavern.

8. ⁠A lizardfolk, with dark scales that shine like small emeralds. They can't see well, relying on hearing when they can. They can often jump to their trusty daggers when they hear an unexpected sound - like a bird's cry, or you, bringing them a cup of tea. Their house is filled with small traps and secret containers, like an old-school dungeon, and their paranoia means they rarely get new visitors.


9. A stout dwarf tattered with slash-marked scars, His right arm was cut off during a time of war, it is replaced with a +1 arm blade. If he falls in battle he will be able to perform one more action before falling unconscious.

10. Once a hermit, this skinny human has learned how to travel unnoticed in the world to survive possible threats. They have proficiency with locksmith tools bonuses to stealth, perception checks. They can also sneak attack like a rogue.

11. This troubled tiefling had once made a pact with a demon that gave it immense power now long forgotten. Some of that power still remains and they can cast a few level 1 warlock spells."
449,"Feel free to skip the next paragraph if you don't care about the backdrop of this idea I have for a 3-shot or mini campaign. 

So I was talking random D&D nonsense with my gaming group, theorycrafting if you could be a level 20 character as you are in the real world what would be the best choice –assuming your the only person with these abilities. Just nonsense D&D nerd stuff, but somehow the conversation became well what if you had to be mono-classed. One friend chimed up asking if it ""changed the calculus"" at all if the class you choose is yours but somewhere in the world there's 12 random other people that gain the other 12 classes. This became I fun conversation, I then posited well if there 13 PCs in the world there would have to be a GM somewhere, but they can't just be all-powerful and everything, instead they have only 2 abilities to award XP (and class levels) and to make rulings. We also added a few other caveats to the GM: the GM doesn't age and can't be harmed by PCs directly or indirectly, the GM can pass on the GM responsibility on to someone else but if they die from any other means someone else who isn't a PC will randomly be selected to be the GM, the GM has to be consistent with their rulings (at least until there was a new GM, who could totally override their rulings). 

It was a fun nonsense conversation but now it's got me wanting to run it as a sandbox mini-campaign. Here's the thing though even if I'm running the session IRL as the DM (I'll use DM and GM to distinguish the difference between the in-universe GM from myself who's actually running all the NPCs and narrating everything) I'm not the ""GM"" so the idea is that we'd start by running everything exactly strict per RAW but every hour or so, in real time, I'd roll a dice and use a table to stimulate a GM ruling coming through, these would be house-rules, buffs, nerfs, homebrew, ect. that'd change the rules slightly. They can be very narrow or somewhat broad, some good and some bad but all random. 

My ask is to help me come up with some rulings that could be randomly implemented. I have some that I use personally, that'd I'd include like:

##d100 Example Rules
1. Bonus Action potion drinking, 
2. Monk's Step of the Wind doesn't require Ki
+2 for flanking
3. nat 20 on ability checks add +5 to the result
4. some 3rd party spell being available like the ones from Dark Arts Player Companion
5. Crit Fumbles (I personally hate this rule, but they don't have to be good rules)
6. Expanded Critical Hit rules (ie roll on a table for a bonus effect)

But what else could I include? 


P.S. There'd also be a descent chance nothing gets changed as a result on the random GM ruling table.


Edit: Formating"
450,"Pathfinder has a downtime event list, found here: [

&#x200B;

They are all pretty awesome, from the generic to the specific. One of my player's opened up a smithy and had his first event occur tonight. Going through them there didn't seem to be enough variety if this becomes common. So I thought we could expand their lists!

&#x200B;

# Generic Events:

1. **Bad Weather**: a particularly bad patch of weather plagues the area. There’s a 10% chance the weather is devastating. Attempt a DC 20 [Survival]( check. If you succeed, you’ve anticipated the weather and your building is unaffected. If you fail, the bad weather damages some of your supplies, and you lose 1d4 points of Goods. If the bad weather is devastating, your building gains the [broken]( condition.
2. **Building-Specific Event**: Roll on the specific table for your building. If there is no event table for that kind of building, reroll this result.
3. **Criminal Activity**: The building is targeted by petty criminals. You can spend 2d4 points of Influence to cause them to leave you alone, negating this event. Otherwise, attempt a DC 20 [Intimidate]( check. If you succeed, the criminals are caught and you gain 1 point of Influence. Otherwise, the criminals rob your building, and you lose 1d8 points of Goods.
4. **Day of Rest**: It’s an unusually relaxing day. Nothing bad happens, and minor events seem to conspire to make all the little things work out perfectly. People are well rested and in good spirits. You gain 1d3 points of Labor.
5. **Deadly Accident**: Someone has a dreadful accident in or near your building. Roll 1d6; on a 1–4, the victim is a random employee or building resident, and on a 5–6, the victim is a visitor or passerby. The GM determines the type of accident. The victim is hurt badly and is [dying]( a successful DC 15 [Heal]( check or the application of any [magical healing]( prevents death. If the person dies, you lose 1d3 points of Influence.
6. **Famous Visitor**: Someone famous visits the settlement. This could be a beloved actress, a vaunted hero, a celebrated noble, or the like. Attempt a DC 20 [Diplomacy]( check. On a success, the famous visitor visits your building, and you gain 1d2 points of Influence. Otherwise you’re snubbed and lose 1d2 points of Influence.
7. **Fire**: a fire breaks out in your building. There’s a 75% chance it’s just a minor fire that costs you 1d2 points of Goods, but otherwise it’s a major fire and becomes a significant danger. For a major fire, unless you utilize magic like [*quench*]( , [*pyrotechnics*]( , or other fire-suppressing tactics, you lose 2d6 points of Goods, Labor, or Magic (splitting this cost up however you wish) and your building gains the [broken]( condition.
8. **Good Fortune**: You have a run of good luck. For 7 days, this building gains a +4 bonus on its first check to generate capital each day. In addition, the next time you roll a building event, you can roll twice and take either result.
9. **Good Weather**: The beautiful weather boosts morale and business. The building gets a +10 bonus on its next check to generate capital.
10. **Infestation**: You have uninvited guests — [spiders]( in the cellar, [stirges]( in the attic, [rats]( in the walls, or something similarly unpleasant. As long as your building is infested, it takes a -10 penalty on checks to generate capital. Each day the infestation continues, you lose 1 point of Goods, Labor, or Magic (chosen randomly, reroll if it’s a type of capital you don’t have). To end an infestation, you must succeed at a DC 20 [Handle Animal]( or [Survival]( check; the DC increases by 1 for each day the infestation persists (maximum DC 30). Alternatively, the GM may allow you to resolve the infestation with a combat encounter.
11. **Rivalry**: a rival starts to work against you. At the start of each Income phase, you must succeed at a DC 20 skill check (with a skill that makes sense for the type of building) or either lose 1d2 points of Influence or give the building a –5 penalty on its checks to generate currency for 1d10 days (50% chance of either penalty). You may attempt a DC 25 [Intimidate]( or [Diplomacy]( check once per day to end the rivalry. Success means the rivalry ends (as does any ongoing penalty from this event). Failure means the rivalry continues. The rivalry ends automatically the next time you roll this event (this doesn’t replace the old rivalry with a new one).
12. **Rumormongering**: People are talking about you. Attempt a DC 20 [Diplomacy]( check. On a success, word spreads far that your presence in the region is valuable and welcomed, and you gain 1d4 points of Influence. On a failure, the rumors are not so complimentary (and perhaps even insulting), and you lose 1d3 points of Influence.
13. **Sickness**: Your employees have become sick, and any earnings from this building today are halved. Attempt a DC 15 [Heal]( check at the end of each day—on a success, your employees get well enough to work. If you fail, the sickness persists to the next day. Each day sickness persists, you have a 20% chance of losing 1d2 points of Labor.
14. **Taxes**: You must pay some unexpected taxes. You can either pay the tax amount (1% of the total gp value of your building) or attempt a DC 20 [Bluff]( check to talk your way out of the taxes. If you succeed, you don’t have to pay these taxes. If you fail, the tax owed doubles and you can’t talk your way out of it.

# Smithy Events:

1.  **Deadly Accident**: This is the same as the deadly accident event from **Generic Building Events**, except that there is also a 25% chance that the accident starts a fire (as the fire event in same section).
2. **Exotic Metal**: A supplier offers to sell you a small amount of [cold iron]( [mithral]( or [adamantine]( p to 1,000 gp worth) at a 20% discount. You may spend Goods, Magic, or gp to pay for this metal.
3. **Forced Commission**: A government official requires a specific commission, but refuses to pay for the service, claiming it is your duty to support the government. If you comply with this [*demand*]( completing the work takes 1d4 days, and the building generates no income for that period of time. If you resist, the official goes elsewhere, and you lose 1d6 points of Influence.
4. **Forge Waste**: An employee ruins some equipment or refined metal. Attempt a DC 30 [Craft]( check appropriate to your Smithy. If you succeed, you are able to [*salvage*]( much of the metal and only lose 1 point of Goods. If you fail, you lose 1d3 points of Goods.
5. **Special Request**: A famous hero, noble, military commander, or similar notable comes to your Smithy with a special request for an unusual or masterwork item—perhaps manacles, a cage, exotic barding, or a replacement piece for an iron [golem]( For 1d4 days, as payments come in for the request, your building gains a +20bonus on its first check to generate capital each day. At the end of this period, attempt a DC 30 [Craft]( check of the appropriate type. On a success, your Smithy has done so well on the request that the customer spreads the word of your skill and you gain 1d6 points of Influence.
6. **Supply Problems**: Your suppliers have a problem—a road is washed out, bandits are thick in the wilds, or an important caravan has been attacked by a monster. In any event, your necessary supplies are running low. You lose 1d3 points of Goods, and for 1d4 days this building takes a –5 penalty on its checks to generates capital.
7. **Unforeseen Masterwork**: Normally, it takes focus, time, and skill to forge a masterwork object, but by chance one of your workers manages to produce one accidentally. You gain 1d10 × 10 gp or 1d10 points of Goods (your choice) for the sale of this item.
8. **Valuable Ore**: Your suppliers send a particularly fine shipment of iron ore or steel bars. You gain 1d4 points of Goods. There’s a 5% chance that the supplier also included precious metals or gemstones worth 5d20 gp by mistake. If you give these back to the supplier instead of keeping them, you gain 1d6 points of Influence."

452,"Original [here](

I decided to cut the max requirement in half because this way it's probably easier and we're almost 40% there! I'm cool if there's multiple employees in a department (especially for my examples, I don't really like the marketing guy example here). The more character traits/stronger the character hook, the better, but it's not required, just appreciated!

List/prompt:

In a fantasy world that's like ours in terms of tech level, shops would probably grow in scale too. If you were to walk into a fantasy corporation, you'd run into:

1. ""Benevolent"" printer mimic
2. Roslyn: Vampire secretary with a southern accent. Surprisingly sunny disposition, given she can't stay alive in sunlight
3. Sara and Kara: Divination witches that work in the finance department. Use a crystal ball to project earnings for the quarter.
4. Emmyth Galemon: Elf with a very rigorous grooming routine every morning. Has to return some tapes.
5. Garfil and D4v3: Dwarf and his golem that handle lifting all the heavy boxes.
6. Ahskel: Devil that works in marketing. Infamous for finding a way to make a faustian bargain sound appealing to even the most pious of clerics.
7. Stanley: The janitor, resurrected into a ghoul so he can ""clean up"" after corpses.
8. Steven Lumiere: Human Life Domain Cleric, head of the Workplace Health and Safety commission. \[ [/James1gal](

11. Selene Silverlight: Elven Druid, is an oversight staff from the Environment Protection Agency, and isn’t always at the office, but has a desk there and comes in a few times a month to review emissions records and occasionally travels to factories owned by the company to perform inspections. \[ [/James1gal]( \]
12. Terry Black: Undead Patron Warlock, his Patron is a VP at the company, and he works directly under his patron as a secretary. \[ [/James1gal]( \]
13. Cix’ra the Eternal: An incredibly ancient Lich Wizard, works as VP of Research and Development, often starts talking in ancient languages without realizing it. \[ [/James1gal]( \]
14. Usinyala, an Erinyes Devil serving under the Arch devil Mammon, works as VP of Finance, since her patron owns 10% shares in the company. \[ [/James1gal](
15. FNG - gnome that’s the new guy and you have to show him the ropes. Constantly talks about how he did it at the old job. \[ [/chdeal713](
16. Gorgosh Hammerprint: Dwarven copysmith. He maintains all the scanners and copiers. In his free time he builds miniature models of famous battleships. \[ [/OwenMcCauley](
17. Rashfa, A Sphinx that manages the Humanoid Resources department. Solves every dispute with her truth-seeing abilities. \[ [/MrMonti\_](
18. Wynndove, Firbolg Druid, old (and likely very insane) groundskeeper. Tends to the lawn and potted office plants. Has a small team of cats, chickens and owls she uses for pest control. \[ [/MrMonti\_](
19. Bill From Accounting: That’s his name, and yes he works in accounting. Yes he knows, he gets that a lot. He’s a wizard when it comes to all things accounting and majored in Extreme Accounting with a minor in Combat Accounting. \[ [/Drbubbles47](
20. Dave. Nobody really knows Dave. They just know that he works here, and that he’s a great guy. Everyone who describes him provides a different description, but everyone has stories of being helpful (all strangely lacking details, like what time it occurred and why Dave was there to begin with). Turns out he’s homeless wizard who’s using spells such Modify Memory, Sympathy, and Alter Self to use the office as a sleeping space and a source of food. \[ /Captain_Cookiez\]
21. An Aboleth living in the coffee machine. They found out how to filter out the toxicity of the mucous. and found out it works like a natural caffeine. The Aboleth gets a constant supply of fresh water, so it’s happy to play along. Be nice to it. The last time someone filled the pot with unfiltered water they woke up in the urinal. \[/Captain_Cookiez\]
22. Aroghor Crowley, the hiring manager. He’s a necromancer, and it turns out that the undead are good workers. Really cuts down on health care costs as well. They aren’t allowed in the lunch room though. Not after the first few made a  mistake about what (or who, in this case) exactly they were allowed to eat. \[/Captain_Cookiez\]

28. Lord Henshaw A rakashasa painter in advertising. He tends to portray the company gorily devouring their rivals. \[ /911roofer\]
29. Heehaw- the gnoll janitor. Eats out of the trash, and finds Henshaw’s art hilarious.  /911roofer\]
30. Jerold- the gnome accountant. Has notes and data on everyone in the company. \[ /911roofer\]

453,"Hi everyone, I am running an adventure with a recurring villain (A more powerful and lich version of Nicol Bolas from MtG in an adapted MtG Multiverse). My problem is, I am running out of scenarios to keep the villain excitement up without straight up maiming my party. 

I have resorted to planning pseudo-combats but I am slowly  running out of ideas:

1. First Encounter was them preparing forever to take a really hard dungeon, just to find it eerily empty, and the BBEG having killed and fucked up everything as a good intro to the power level

2. Second encounter is going to be a fight where they think they are fighting BBEG but it's just a hologram at about 5% strength

3. They are fighting a minion of the BBEG, yet he is true polymorphed to be the boss until he falls unconscious.

4. I have planned a classic chase combat encounter, after they reached the end of the first act and really fiddled the BBEG's plans, with them slowing and hindering the boss as best they can until they have escaped into another dimension.

5. They are fighting against the BBEG at full power, but under the protection of a very powerful spell, they have to crumble the room around the BBEG and use an item to teleport out themselves.

6. Have Nicol Bolas send his minions after them. If he can maim them, maybe he doesn't think they're a threat to face directly /Osellic]

7. The party teams up with one of the lich's peers in order to fight the lich on equal footing. The lich could summon a henchman to deal with the pests while he fights his peer /RevengerBadger]

8. The party has to evacuate a handful of people from a city that the lich is wiping off the map /RevengerBadger]

9. A competition that relies on wits and strategy as well as battle prowess, perhaps overseen by a god or similar entity so that the lich can’t cheat. /RevengerBadger]

10. The party has an extremely valuable, and fragile, item that the lich needs. The lich must fight the party without dealing any damage/RevengerBadger]

Anyone got more ideas for similar combat? Thanks in advance!

EDIT: Planning to use my own spins of the Theros and Amon-Khet settings, respectively set in a greek and ancient egyptian setting, if that sparks any ideas!"
454,"\##The ask

I could use help coming up with a series of 'events' or 'prompts' that the players would respond to as they create a shared background.

Let me put it into context. Imagine you and your traveling companions (friends, rivals, parents, etc.) are starting out on the Oregon trail - but this reality has deadly, otherworldy, and magical monsters that make the bear that attacked DeCaprio in 'The Revenant' look like a teddy bear. You're all supplied up and hitting the trail.Eventually, you'll arrive at a place where you build your settlement. This could be the promised land, it could be where you ran out of supplies. It could just be a nice patch of land that you like. Whatever the case the end point is where you call home.

But these 'events' (or what I call Vignettes) take place between the start and endpoints. It's focused on your journey and how you and your companions dealt with situations that crop up.The top of the list is the beginning of your journey while the later part of the list is near the end.

\##housekeeping

Humans don't have magic. Only the creatures are magical. Humans, however, can capture monsters and or create equipment from magical parts of the monsters.

Humanity as you know it is lost to time - something happened and now most of the technology of today has been lost leaving us closer to a world like Horizon Zero Dawn (minus the robot dinos). Some inspiration I've been drawing from is the aforementioned Horizon games, Tales from the Loop, and Warded man.

I only need a list of 24.

\##The list

1. A tree falls and blocks your caravan's path. It's clear on sight that this was no accident. As you stop you can hear shifting in the wilds as something prepares to engage the caravan. How do you get out manage an escape?
2. While fording a river the current unexpectedly picks up and topples over one of your caravan carts. A mess of resources and equipment quickly rushes down the river and toward a waterfall. How do you manage to recover some or all of your goods and get to safety?
3. While crossing a lake it becomes clear there is something lurking deep under the dark surface of the water. Your slow-moving makeshift boats make for easy prey and the chase is on. How do you avoid certain death?
4. In the distance a dull shrieking cuts through the air. It's alarming and otherworldly in such a way that informs you it is of the 'old world'. Before the blaring shrieks can end the sounds of a stampede alert you to impending danger. How do you get through the situation?
5. An NPC was injured while scouting ahead. Before they were harmed they managed to spot a clearing ahead. However, during the incident, they have been turned around and Can't be sure where the clearing is. How do you proceed?
6.  A small community is found dead. Any survivors have long since fled and all that remains are the ghosts that accumulate at such places. Your resources have run low and the dead community’s supply could mean another day of traveling or the end of the line. How do you and the community respond? "
455,"I made a whole bunch of names for groups in my Strixhaven campaign so that the 'house cup' style competition would feel a little bit more fleshed out (see Group Points in *Strixhaven: A Syllabus of Sorcery*, by Arcane Eye). Many of these are puns or reference things from the D&D lore and I have an idea in my mind of what the group's (4-person) composition looks like but I'll leave that off so you can interpret it as you want to. I made top 10 teams for all the years as well as a bottom team with a more inappropriate name. Accordingly, every 11th name will be less wholesome or reference some kind of trouble-making.

This post and Regill from Pathfinder - Wrath of the Righteous have made me rethink evil as possibly being simply defined 'selfish' and good as 'altruistic'. I'd be interested to see more examples of how this could pan out in a campaign without derailing it.

How would they think of themselves and how would that cause them to act? The character is goal oriented - which seems uncaring. They are efficient - which seems ruthless. They are probably relatively private? They probably disdain unnecessary acts of goodness - seeing them as weakness? Do they actively try to harm others for perverse reasons, with plausible deniability, or do they simply not care and view the world through a lens of extreme pragmatism?

Key words.

Efficiency. Goal oriented. Plausible deniability. Pragmatism. 'Cultural heritage'.

Examples:

1. The camp is under attack and there are precious seconds left to reach safety. They see soldiers struggling to carry the wounded to safety, being cut down because of this altruism. They order the murder of the remaining wounded to leave no choice but to flee for the safety of the caves.
2. The character's power source is dark and requires regular sacrifices. The character hides these from the party, tries to focus on 'deserving' sacrifices such as enemies, and they do a lot towards defeating the enemies of good (on their path to personal power, not caring if good or evil prevail).
3. You are quick to capitalise on disaster as a means to test your new invention/potion/spell. Oh no! The enemy is upon us! I must empower the villagers with this new magic.
4. Arsonist Red Mage. Joined the party for fun and freedom from pesky enforcement.
5. Lizardfolk druid/necromancer, who eats corpses of defeated enemies, and tries to convince others to do so as well, because it is part of their culture /kamajkore](
6. Argue against the innocence of bystanders as an excuse to use them in dark rituals to further your power and influence.
7. A monk of Io who believes that any murder makes you an inherently evil person and since he committed murder then he is beyond redemption. So now he goes with the party to kill other violent people/creatures /RexMori](
8. Torturer. Works as a bounty hunter as an excuse to practice the art. No-one asks how he gets his information, and he doesn't volunteer the fact.
9. Necromancer. Actively put the undead to work in service of the living. Townsfolk love him. All he asks is that they hold their funerals on his land...
10. Nobleman forced by tradition or boredom into adventuring. Lawful Evil in that he knows his place, and the place of others around him.
11. Looter. You are with the party for the loot, for backstory reasons, rather than the cause of righteousness. You may go concerningly too far in 'helping'. /NonCoreNova](
12. Knife-o-phile. You stab only who you're allowed to, within the limits that society tolerates; as often as you can. [
13. The Good Strategy. Truly believes that good causes have mixed motives and really want power and wealth, He likewise will use this altruism strategy as it appears effective in building a movement and community, it doesn't mean he'll enjoy it or allow himself to make ""mistakes"" in the process. Everyone sacrifices a little to get what they want. /NecessaryCornflake7](
14. Religious Zealot. They read holy books and looks the part but grossly misinterprets them to justify evil deeds in the name of the religion. Externally is pious and devout, but internally uses cleverness and wit to get what they want. Witch hunts, Inquisitions, and tortuous exorcisms are their passion. /NecessaryCornflake7](
15. Lone Executioner. Doesn't believe in forgiveness, but in retribution for wrongs. Someone has to hold them accountable and it's going to be me. Even if the law won't allow for it or has nothing to do with me. I get to be the judge of that. /NecessaryCornflake7](
16. Bread Thieves. The group suffered from poverty and stole from certain accepted individuals to survive at an early age. This propels itself when they meet others in desperate need as well. ""The rich take enough from us, what's a little stealing going to do to provide bread on the tables for us and others?"" /NecessaryCornflake7](
17. Nature preserver. The cities and towns are corrupt, tearing apart nature and the animals that live in it. They care only about themselves. I'm not going to stand around and allow them to flourish while I'm still alive. Someone has to keep the balance. Time to feed the soil with death, so nature can flourish. /NecessaryCornflake7](
18. A chaotic evil character who delights in the destruction the party causes, reigned in by the party who insists on unleashing this destruction only on those deserving. /CoruscareGames](
19. A wizard seeking lichdom, insisting they take the soul of the party's very much human enemy (human in the sense that they're a mortal and fully of the Material Plane). /CoruscareGames](
20. There's the classic ""using evil to defeat evil"". You might be a piece of shit and an awful person for whole sale slaughtering a village and raising their corpses to fight, but the real evil is the incoming demon horde that plans on killing literally everything. What's one village in the face of the whole Material Plane? [**Legaladvice420**](
21. Or one I really like for the whole playing an evil character in a good hero game - you can't rule the world if the whole world is dead. [**Legaladvice420**](
22. Oh, or you can be the scheming liar. You never personally held the knife that killed the king - but your lies wormed their way into the ears of his advisors, slowly twisting their perception of reality until the only clear choice to save the kingdom was to kill the king. [**Legaladvice420**](
23. Cleric or follower of an evil God, but this evil God is under threat by the antagonist the rest if the party is fighting. Enemy of mye enemy is my riend after all /DeadEspeon](
24. Or the God is already harmed or destroyed and now it is time for vengeance /DeadEspeon](
25. Character is seeking fame as a hero, bit is only good when there is an audience. The goals to be remembered well after they die, becaus ethat's the closest they can reasonably get to immortality (liches get stitches) /DeadEspeon](
26. A wandering bard who is actually a spy for one of the planes of hell. They are friendly and charming to the party when encountered, but will sell any useful information to their hellish master in exchange for power down below. /cutiefey](
27. A member of the party is an egomaniac who is trying to start his own cult. The rest of the party might not feel great about that, but the cultists are so very helpful... /Erivandi](
28. The party are set upon by a murderous gang of halflings, and it just so happens that a member of the party had an irrational hatred of halflings /Erivandi](
29. A necromancer desecrates a graveyard to raise zombies to protect the town he's in. /Erivandi](
30. Charlatan Doctor offering new secret long life medicine to those on their death beds. Is actually a vampire. /LucidFir](
31. Some kind of alchemist who has come up with novel uses for the body parts of magical creatures normally considered sacrosanct... But surely the life of any mere creature is worth less than that of a sapient? He doesn't actually need to kill unicorns, he just likes doing so. /LucidFir](
32. A female rogue/assassin who was taken as a child and sold into the sex slavery trade. After escaping has made a life’s mission of killing all men with no remorse. She is irredeemable and does not openly share her life’s goal with the other characters. She will continue to play along with the adventures while secretly exterminating all male NPCs as possible; particularly those nobles and higher classes. /ofcbrooks](
33. Warlock - has a patron that wishes to take over the world, subjugation, and all that jazz. As it turns out, an entirely different evil entity wants to do the exact same thing - and said other evil is going to beat the patron to the punch. The patron does *not* like this, so orders their minion to smash the evil. You may as well stick with the heroes to do that, right? Five or six is better then one. /TAGMOMG](
34. Benevolent Tyrant. Will lead people into new age of prosperity and happiness, whether they like it or not. (Think Vetinari from Discworld) /Arabidopsidian](
35. A bird. As in, play your character with the savagery and hubris of a bird. /CoruscareGames](
458,"Some examples: blindness, nightmares that prevent rest, strength decreases day by day, intelligence decreases day by day, mortal food no longer sustains you, etc…

Go crazy! Just has to be a curse…
If you prefer boons, I made a post for that too…

List update: 

1. Blindness
2. Nightmares that prevent rest
3. Strength decreases day by day
4. Intelligence decreases day by day
5. Mortal food no longer sustains you
6. Your heart beats audibly, like bass cranked up too loud
7. You take on elements of the deity’s appearance overtime (imposing debuffs at the GMs discretion). E.g. you grow massive curling horns that slow you down, reducing your speed by 10 ft. 
8. Your heartbeat is so loud it imposes disadvantage on all perception checks made by you or those within 5 ft of you. 
9. The deities blood pushes harmlessly through your skin concealing into the deities symbol of faith somewhere on the body marking you as the faith slayer You gain vulnerability to a set number of attacks and spells of anyone of that particular faith and those of said faith will know what you did upon seeing you"
459,"&#x200B;

1. Backwards long jumping (such that he can clip through walls and doors when building up speed)
2. Bloated bombs pushing Mario backwards (such that he can clip through walls and doors due to high speed)
3. First frame wall kicking (such that he can clip through walls and doors with enough speed)
4. C-up slide (can gain a lot of speed on downward sideways slopes)
5. Failing his 3rd death save inside of a cannon (launching the cannon at this point and playing a cutscene will cause him to not do anything, but not technically die)"

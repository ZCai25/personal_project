53,"A lump of enchanted patchwork flesh that turns into any of the monsters on this list with their associated ability, for 12 hours (d100 for what it turns into)."
54,"A baby. For everyone else, this IS a baby; to the owner, it is a living embodiment of their own magical will. It cannot be killed by mundane or magical means, and for all intents and purposes is indestructible; but if the spellcaster is damaged, the baby is damaged (which also means, if the spellcaster dies, the baby dies). Think 'Portrait of Dorian Gray', kinda. Additional: a psychic link between caster and baby reveals the baby is himself--and thus, can converse with the baby/himself psychically or verbally (but the baby cannot speak, itself). It is able to move--'crawl'--up to a few meters away, and can share what it sees with the caster. Basically, it can do baby things, and obeys commands that the caster gives it, to the physical limit of a baby. Note-slash-edit: using the baby as an object (re: 'I'll just go around and beat everyone with it then!') saps the spellcaster of any goodness inside them--the more evil they become, the more blackened, bruised, and ugly the baby gets."
55,"A lion turtle (yeah, THAT lion turtle. Not super huge, as it ain't too old yet--think 'average tortoise'-sized. Which, I also suppose, means it's still in it's infancy?). Can either: hold extra spell slots for the caster, or turn one spell per day into a spell level higher (turtles' choice--which, really, is GM's choice), cast a random spell as needed, or finally, lets it's owner reroll a saving throw (boost of luck)."

63,A green fox that laughs like a small child. Provokes a chance of madness in those who tell it bad jokes.
64,The spirit of a town drunk. The drunk is not dead; his spirit just leaves his body whenever he becomes 'blackout drunk'. Useful as much as you think a spirit would be.
65,"Bees. You wear their 'queen' in a golden amber oval around your neck; it cannot be stolen, as it has adhered to your flesh (it just LOOKS like it's a necklace). Eating/drinking your hive's honey imbues more magical potency. Making/drinking mead doubles it (but, it's mead, so it'll getcha drunk). The honey potency only applies to you, but the mead can be sold and applied to anyone--but again, it's mead, so it'll get them drunk."
66,"A magical, sentient brick that can communicate with you telepathically."
67,A cat-sized Praying Mantis.

72,An animated feather that writes whatever the owner wishes in anyones' handwriting if treated nicely and is provided ink.
73,"A small palm sized cube slime. Can be placed in any room and will relay what has been spoken when the owner holds it telepathically. It must be fed small rodents and insects daily, or it will dissolve."

81,"A mimic that stays as the users backpack. When thrown at an enemy it attempts to devour it against a strength check. If it fails then it just does 1d4 damage and ,ust be retrieved by the PC."
82,An invisible spirit that can't talk. It has the mage hand spell as an ability.
83,"A large parrot that is able to translate the more common languages, but yells the translation directly into the spellcaster's Ear."
84,"A small cat-sized Owlbear that has a natural aptitude for finding things (+1 on investigation rolls). Like most Owlbears it has a large appetite and is almost constantly hungry. If it's left unfed for too long it tends to be temperamental (doesn't help in investigations) and, for some reason, makes attempts to eat the shoes of the spellcaster."
85,A Kua-toa child. Fiercely loyal to the caster and views them as a divine figure. They can manifest minor clerical powers through their devotion alone.

87,"A sentient clam that happily babbles in an unknown language, assumedly Clam. It sings amazingly despite its incomprehensible language, and has advantage on all performance checks involving singing. A patient spellcaster may be able to pick up the language if they are persistent."
88,"A will-o'-wisp that has taken an interest in the spellcaster and follows them of its own free will. It is mischevious and a tad cruel by nature, and occasionally floats off for hours at a time before returning. It often zaps party members at inoppurtune times, and lingers after fights to consume the souls of the fallen. That aside, it is still supportive of the caster and readily provides backup as a distraction during truly dire combat. It occasionally acts as a guide when the spellcaster is lost, though it will sometimes play tricks on the caster in the same way. When the spellcaster is casting a spell, the will-o'-wisp circles the caster at rapid speeds, and will add an additional 2d8 of lightning damage to it if the spell also does lighting damage."
89,"A sentient transparent orb filled with smoke, that also doubles as a spellcasting focus for the caster. It communicates through movement of the smoke, with peaceful drifting indicating contentment and violent swirling indicating agitation. After gaining trust in the spellcaster over a long period of time, the spellcaster will begin to see pictures in the smoke that only they can see, which hint at the history of the orb."
90,"An oddly colored caterpillar the size of a human arm. It enjoys sunbathing on the caster's head and eating the caster's clothing. The caterpillar will eventually enter an unnaturally hard cocoon in which it will undergo metamorphosis into an enormous butterfly. The butterfly will continue to follow the spellcaster if they propery cared for it before its metamorphosis, and can cast Giant Insects without concentration as a spell-like ability once per day."
91,"A small, seemingly conscious cloud of blueish smoke. Can distract and hinder enemies by hovering by their mouth and nostrils, but otherwise doesn't do much other than following it's master."
92,A chameleon that can't quite manage to match whatever color it is hiding against but can occasionally display distant images or things it has seen.

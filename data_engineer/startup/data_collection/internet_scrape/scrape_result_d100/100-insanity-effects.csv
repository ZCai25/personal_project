You do everything in your power to travel to this lake. DM decides how far away it is. You know it's the right lake when you get there. Once you arrive, you find it to be very much so not on fire. Take 3d10 psychic damage as you struggle to reconcile this, and the madness ends."

72,"The afflicted never lets one of their senses function properly because they falsely believe that they are better without that sense.

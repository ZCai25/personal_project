Guards hate her above almost all other prisoners, knowing she'd gladly turn her targets into further 'paintings'."

He was brutal, honest, and captured by the palace guards when they asked him to start signing his work; reportedly, he's still working from inside of the prison, except his rates are infinitely more affordable.

28,"Anna - Kept in a dark room and bound with magic sigils, Anna is a deeply motivated, highly disturbed wandering killer, captured after a five-year hunt by professional adventurers; her modus operandi was to disguise herself as an orphan human child, infiltrate colonial outposts, and then systematically destroy food, water, and medical supplies, forcing the pioneers into madness, murder, and cannibalism.

31,"Aldac - Former adventurer, expedition guide, reformed arsonist, and now a leader of a prison yard 'exercise group', this monk is a dangerous person; some say that she's building an army, others that it's a cult, and nobody wants to test her in a straight fight since she crippled her last opponent in under ten seconds. Anything that requires focus and determination, she's happy to offer her thoughts on, free of charge - provided that she's shown proper respect first. Her sentence is for a triple life duration - tough luck for her, as her species is a long-lived one."
32,"Thack - A monstrous human, he was a warlord by age fifteen, a respected bandit king at twenty, and captured during his attempt to seize the capital itself, turned over by his own command structure in exchange for lenient sentencing for war crimes.

33,"Rejoice-Cried-The-Kraken - Still living her best life, RJCTK is a priestess first, bandit second, and a model prisoner third, choosing to ignore her history of piracy and looting in exchange for running a small group of like-minded believers in the church she's built in her cell; she served as a first officer on the flagship of a vast pirate fleet, choosing who lived and who was sacrificed to her deity, often by slow drowning or something that officials referred to as 'hook dancing'. She makes a few extra coins giving nautical theme tattoos for fellow prisoners, each one a work of art worthy of a church's stained-glass windows."
34,"Prisoner #644 - Captured at the frontier, whatever it is, it's only eaten six times in ten years, each time it was an unwary guard who strayed too close to the sealed cage covered in a thick burlap sheet. It hums at night, an eerie, unsettling event taking place only just before the onset of riots, uprisings, and acts of revenge on a wide scale inside of the prison. Recently, guards have reported that it has started to sing softly. Each of the Dead prisoners killed in the previous ten years are named, one by one, and it chuckled wetly when younger guards approach it."

Rumors persist that their natural lethality came from a tradeoff with a powerful Demon."
47,"Semaj Ironscreamer - An elderly Half-Orc Druid who has spent half his life in this cell. He was jailed after being involved in multiple eco-terrorist attacks on mining towns that had been dumping their industrial waste into the nearby rivers. Seen as a kindly grandfather figure by the other inmates and even some of the guards, Semaj is often the peacekeeper between those he can hear from his cell and dispenses wisdom to those who ask.

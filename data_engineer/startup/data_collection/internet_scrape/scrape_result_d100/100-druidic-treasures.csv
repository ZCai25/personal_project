The crown has a soft inner luminescence reminiscent of the night sky, making the wearer emit dim light in a 10-foot radius while they wear it. Attuning to the crown grants the wearer the ability to use the crown’s properties, as well as immunity to cold damage as well as blindsight out to 60 feet. Both properties can only be used if the wearer is directly under the open night sky. Once per day, the wearer may use an action to use the crown’s Herald of Winter property to change the weather in a 3-mile around the point they activate this property to some sort of snowy weather of the wearer’s choosing. This weather can range anywhere from a gentle snowfall to a moderately strong blizzard, and requires 1d4 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. The weather lasts for 8 hours, and requires no concentration to maintain. In addition, three times per day, the wearer may use an action to use the crown’s Freezing Light property. The wearer may conjure a brilliant moonbeam from the sky, filled with fast-moving freezing mist, forcing all creatures in its 10 foot radius between the ground and the sky to make a Constitution saving throw against the wearer’s spell save DC. A creature takes 3d10 cold damage and 3d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Any creature that fails the saving throw is also blinded and has their movement speed reduced to 0 for the next minute as their eyes are burned and their feet are frozen. The creature can make a Constitution saving at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the creature is no longer blinded and its movement speed is returned to normal."

The scimitar is a +2 magical weapon innately, with an additional property that can be activated if the wielder attunes to the blade. Once per day, the wielder may use an action to use the blade’s Shroud of Autumn property if they are attuned to the scimitar. The wielder calls forth a swirling cyclone of leaves around themselves in a 5-foot radius for up to a minute. While the cyclone is active, all ranged attacks made against the wielder have disadvantage. If the property is used while within an area with moderate density foliage, the cyclone instead has a 10-foot radius and causes all melee attacks to be made with disadvantage as well. The wielder also gains the ability to use their reaction to cause a ranged attack passing through the cyclone to automatically miss its target. The wielder may stop the cyclone and have the leaves drift away using a bonus action on their turn. If the property is used while within an area with high-density foliage, the cyclone gains new benefits in addition to the previous improvements. The cyclone instead has a 15-foot radius, which is considered difficult terrain while the cyclone is active, and all ranged attacks not made by the wielder automatically miss if they enter the cyclone. One time while the cyclone is active, the wielder can form blade replicas from the swirling leaves to attack a multitude of foes. By doing so, the wielder uses an action to make a single melee weapon attack with the scimitar against any number of creatures inside the cyclone, with a separate attack roll for each target."
96,Coral Marstaff: A reef-like quarterstaff that is covered in suspended globules of water which act as portals to the nearest body of water.

99,"Moon Sickle of Cressk: Using this platinum, silver, and gold weapon to harvest mistletoe under light of the full moon lets you make a Druid Grove permanent in only half the time (6 months in-game). If you happen to find a suitable stump you can leave this weapon and the requisite material components in a forcecage within the Druid Grove and in one year it will have been made permanent by trapping a small part of you in a time loop just long enough to complete the ritual. Occasionally it has been known to fail and release a druid from the time loop should they die elsewhere."
100,"Mask of the Crystal Sea: an egg shaped mask cut from an angular, opalescent crystal. The wearer of this mask not only gains +3 to perception checks to spot fey creatures but also receives fey as a bonus language. The fairies of the western wood call the mask “Syliang” meaning “god shorn.”"

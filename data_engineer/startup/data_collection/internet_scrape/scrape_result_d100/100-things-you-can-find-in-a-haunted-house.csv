12,"A small drop of blood moves across the floor leaving behind a thin red line. No matter how far the small drop moves it never runs out of blood to leave behind. The small blood drop leads the party room to room, floor to floor."
13,"In random locations throughout the house you stumble across a recently lit cigar, sitting in an ash try, the corner of a mantle or an edge of a table."

69,A room that has torches in sconces lining the walls. In the center of the room is a single candle that sheds darkness instead of light.
70,"A wall painted with a glowing runic symbol. The symbol stabilizes the house. If the symbol is ever broken, wiped, or otherwise erased away the rooms are no longer organized, such that they teleport constantly (example: you enter the kitchen from the dining room, but when you go back through the same door to reach the kitchen, instead you are in a bedroom)."

94,"A puppet that will animate itself once the adventurers approach it. Treat as a Tiny Goblin. Once killed, it can be controlled by the party's MU and can fly(As broom of such) and float through walls. With 10 charges, it can become invisible for 5 seconds. Each invisibility costs one charge. The puppet cannot attack, but it can mimic. Everyone besides the party members and their friends insist that a demon controls the puppet."
95,"A comfortably furnished room with a fire laid in the grate ready to be lit, doors which lock properly, and several sofas which are large enough to sleep on. Any sound produced in this room will be delayed by half a second. Talking is difficult when you hear your own voice echoed back at you. The delay increases by a second every hour somebody spends in the room, and decreases by a second every hour they're out of it. This could be used creatively to give a bonus to Sneak checks."
96,"A wasp's nest built out of an old spellbook. Disassembling and reassembling the spells has mostly destroyed them, but careful examination by a magic user reveals that they belonged to the school of Necromancy. An entire day spent carefully dissecting the nest may allow it to be used as a spellbook, granting a random 3rd level Necromancy spell. Roll Intelligence (Arcana) DC20 to decipher the spell (Identify doesn't work, as the spell isn't intact yet), plus an additional 8d20 to represent each hour working on the nest - any 1s trigger a wild magic surge for that hour. The nest contains no living wasps, and can be taken with you if enough time is dedicated to digging it out of the wall."
97,"A small animal dissection room. The walls are covered in carefully framed and preserved dissected animals - a rabbit, a crow, a cat, and many others - each one spread and pinned open with its internal organs pinned around it. On the desk is a robin in the process of being dissected, with tools neatly laid out around it. The room smells strongly of formaldehyde, and the tools don't show any signs of rust or age."
98,"A child's bedroom, with a child seemingly asleep in the bed. Closer examination reveals that the child is dead, but without any visible means of death or signs of decay. The first person to touch the child will start to receive dreams of the room, with the child standing in it looking sad. At first the child is at the opposite end of the room, but with each dream they get closer and start to reach out their hand. After seven such dreams, the child will take the character's hand in the dream, and smile. Once this happens, the child's ghost will attempt to Possess the character (see Ghost / Possession) - the child doesn't mean any ill will, just wants to be alive again. Remove Curse will end the dreams."
99,"A strange pendant. Anyone looking at it gets a foreboding sense of dread. If no one touches it, the pendant appears in other rooms. It's always in an unobtrusive location within each room. If anyone checks, the pendant is indeed missing from it's previous location."
100,"A creepy marionette puppet sitting in an armchair. When you look away or leave the room, the next time you see the armchair, the strings are cut and the puppet is missing."

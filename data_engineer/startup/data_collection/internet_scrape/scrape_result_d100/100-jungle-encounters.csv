1,The party comes across a cave filled with mushrooms that emit a strange blue glow.
2,"Whoever is last in the party feels a small tug on their pant leg. When they look down, a Chwinga is offering them a small necklace made of sea shells."
3,A few baboons begin howling at the party below. This attracts the attention of a nearby enemy.
4,"A group of tribesmen are hunting a large dinosaur nearby. They have not spotted the party, and it looks like they could use some help."

6,You see the bones of a creature in the under growth. It has been picked clean by scavengers.
7,While resting a small swarm of loudly croaking frogs hop through the camp. Anyone touched by the frogs dreams prophetic dreams that nights.
8,"While moving through a river a few faintly glowing leeches attach themselves, but it’s not blood they’re draining but magic itself."
9,A thick curtain of vines hangs before you blocking the path. If looking carefully small jungle creatures can be seen entwined. When cut the vines quickly strike like snakes trying to ensnare the party.
10,Suddenly an empty clearing appears ahead nothing but dry grey skeletal trees hanging with a yellow moss.
11,Along the path primitive markers are spaced every 50 foot starting as humanoid in shape each seems more demonic.

17,A weathered leather journal is found covered in small scratch marks. Insides is the diary of a treasure hunter. The writing quickly turns into ineligible scribbles after the hunter thinks they’re into something.
18,"You see a brilliantly colored bird flit through the trees ahead, cawing and crying through the jungle air. It lands on a branch and screeches at you, before flying off."
19,"You come across the rotting remains of a cart, alongside rusting armor and fetid bones. A tattered and unreadable banner hangs at the front of the procession. The line of bodies, carts and bones stretches almost a mile long through the forest. Nothing of value remains but bones and rot."
20,"The party passes an old tree with dozens of ancient tunes and carvings burned into its wooden surface. Occasionally, one of the runes glows a gentle blue, sending off pearlescent but harmless sparks, before going dark once again."
21,A trio of jungle cats gnaw on the body of an unidentifiable creature. They scatter into the woods as the party nears.
22,"A man who must have been alive mere hours before, lies dead in the jungle heat. He wears no armor, but is covered in deep, bloody wounds, and some type of poison fills his veins."

30,"A witch’s hut sits in a small clearing. When approached, the hut stands up on giant chicken legs and flees."
31,You enter into a clearing and shrieking starts. A patch of Shrieker plant is found a few yards ahead. The sound reaches to anything within 300 feet of it.
32,You feel your left elbow get caught on something sticky. A giant spider web has caught your arm. A Giant Spider’s eyes lock on you from 60 feet away.

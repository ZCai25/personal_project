    - Reddit sentiment analysis pipeline
        - The project aims to develop an automated scalable machine-learning pipeline to perform
clustering and sentiment analysis of world news on Reddit. The main objective is to apply the
concepts learned from Distributed Data Systems to collect, preprocess, and transform data into
useful information. The project will produce word clouds and sentiment analysis, which will help
understand the sentiment of the news.

        - Background
            - The Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG) industry has seen rapid growth over the last five years and is expected to grow even further in the coming years. In 2021 the industry was worth $2.5 Billion and is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 5.3% until 2031. This large market is one of the fastest-growing spaces for creative content creators to turn their imaginations into dollars. The creative process is both a long and highly skilled process, which makes it a perfect candidate for automation through a Large Language Model (LLM). Rather than relying on the imagination of a creative person, the idea is to use a LLM to take the place of the creative process and generate content rapidly and without a subject matter expert in the loop.
